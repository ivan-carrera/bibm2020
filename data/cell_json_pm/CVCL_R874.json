"document": "Secondary combined resistance to the multidrug resistance reversing activity of cyclosporin A in the cell line F4 6RADR CsA Multidrug resistant tumor cells can be resensitized by combined application of the selecting cytostatic drug and a chemosensitizer  such as cyclosporin A  CsA   or a calcium channel blocker  Since clinical trials on the circumvention of multidrug resistance  MDR  with chemosensitizers report disparate results  we investigated whether tumor cells of the MDR phenotype can develop additional resistance to the cytostatic chemosensitizer combination  Thus  the Adriamycin ADR  selected  P glycoprotein positive MDR Friend leukemia cell line F4 6RADR was exposed to stepwise increased concentrations of CsA at a constant level of 0 05 microgram ml ADR  The initial CsA concentration  plus 0 05 microgram ml ADR  to inhibit cell growth of F4 6RADR cells by 50   IC50  was 0 04 microgram ml  By continuous incubation for more than 6 months  the IC50 for CsA  at constant ADR  was elevated to 3 6 micrograms ml  90 fold   thus generating the variant F4 6RADR CsA  The F4 6RADR CsA cells were cross resistant for cyclosporin H  CsH   a non immunosuppressive derivative of CsA  As shown by immunocytochemistry as well as by the polymerase chain reaction and by Western blotting including densitometry  P glycoprotein was preserved in the F4 6RADR CsA variant and was expressed at a 4 fold higher level than in F4 6RADR cells  Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis could detect no new proteins in F4 6RADR CsA as compared to F4 6RADR  Interestingly  resistance of F4 6RADR CsA cells remained reversible for the calcium antagonists verapamil and  dihydropyridine B859 35  dexniguldipine HCl   indicating that CsA and these compounds interfere with the P glycoprotein function by different pharmacodynamic mechanisms  Transport studies with  14C ADR  performed in the presence and absence of chemosensitizers  confirmed the good correlation of P glycoprotein function with the pattern of resistance found in proliferation assays  Cellular accumulation of  3H cyclosporin was reduced to 71  of that of the F4 6 controls in F4 6RADR CsA cells  but remained at the level of controls in F4 6RADR cells  Results indicate that increased amounts of the P glycoprotein  besides other  perhaps more important mechanisms that are as yet unknown  partially mediate CsA  resistance in F4 6RADR CsA cells  We have designated this new form of resistance  \"secondary combined resistance\"  SCR   The results suggest that at least some clinical cases of insensitivity to chemosensitizers or of relapse after reversing therapy could be explained by SCR  and that resensitizing treatment of tumor patients should be based on the consideration of several chemosensitizers of different pharmacodynamics", "cell_id": "CVCL_R874"}, {"title": "Evaluation of antigen specific recognition and cell mediated cytotoxicity by a modified

colon carcinoma model BACKGROUND: Antigen specific CD8  cytotoxic T lymphocytes represent potent effector cells of the adaptive immune response against viruses as well as tumours  Therefore assays capable at exploring the generation and function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes represent an important objective for both clinical and experimental settings  METHODS: Here we show a simple and reproducible assay for the evaluation of antigen specific CD8  cytotoxic T lymphocytes based on a LysiSpot technique for the simultaneous determination of antigen specific IFN \u03b3 production and assessment of tumor cytolysis  The assay was developed within an experimental model of colorectal carcinoma  induced by the colorectal tumor cell line DHD K12  that induces tumors in BDIX rats and  in turn  elicits a tumor  specific immune response  RESULTS: Using DHD K12 cells transfected to express Escherichia coli \u03b2 galactosidase as target cells  and by the fine setting of spot colours detection  we have developed an in vitro assay that allows the recognition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes induced in BDIX rats as well as the assessment of anti tumour cytotoxicity  The method highlighted that in the present experimental model the tumour antigen specific immune response was bound to killing target cells in the proportion of 55   while 45  of activated cells were not cytotoxic but released IFN \u03b3  Moreover in this model by an ELISPOT assay we demonstrated the specific recognition of a nonapeptide epitope called CSH 275 constitutionally express in DHD K12 cells  CONCLUSIONS: The assay proved to be highly sensitive and specific  detecting even low frequencies of cytotoxic activated cells and providing the evaluation of cytokine expressing T cells as well as the extent of cytotoxicity against the target cells as independent functions  This assay may represent an important tool to be adopted in experimental settings including the development of vaccines or immune

observed the enrichment of Annexin A1 protein at cell movement structures like lamellipodial extrusions and interestingly  a significant decrease in levels of the protein in HG conditions  The analysis of the translocation of Annexin A1 to cell membrane showed lower levels of Annexin A1 in both membrane pool and supernatants of WS1 cells treated with HG  Wound healing assays using cell line
