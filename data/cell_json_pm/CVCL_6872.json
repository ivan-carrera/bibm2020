synthesis and oxidation by the AMP activated protein kinase The AMP activated protein kinase  AMPK  is a sensor of cellular energy charge and a 'metabolic master switch'  When activated by ATP depletion  it switches off ATP consuming processes  while switching on catabolic pathways that generate ATP  AMPK exists as heterotrimeric complexes comprising catalytic alpha subunits and regulatory beta and gamma subunits  each of which occurs as multiple isoforms  Rising AMP and falling ATP  brought about by various types of cellular stress  including exercise in skeletal muscle   stimulate the system in an ultrasensitive manner  Acetyl CoA carboxylase  ACC  exists in mammals as two isoforms  termed ACC 1 and ACC 2  also known as ACC alpha and ACC beta   AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates both isoforms at the equivalent site  Knockout mice  and other approaches  suggest that the malonyl CoA produced by ACC 2 is exclusively involved in regulation of fatty acid oxidation  whereas that produced by ACC 1 is utilized in fatty acid synthesis  Activation of AMPK by cellular stress or exercise therefore switches on fatty acid oxidation  via phosphorylation of ACC 2  while switching off fatty acid synthesis  via phosphorylation of ACC 1   The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains single genes encoding homologues of the alpha  beta and gamma subunits of AMPK  DmAMPK   and of ACC  DmACC   Studies in a Drosophila embryonal cell line show that DmAMPK  is activated by stresses that cause ATP depletion  oligomycin  hypoxia or glucose deprivation  and that this is associated with phosphorylation of the site on DmACC equivalent to the AMPK sites on mammalian ACC 1 and ACC 2  This is abolished when expression of DmAMPK is ablated using an RNA interference approach  proving that DmAMPK is necessary for phosphorylation of DmACC in response to ATP depletion", "cell_id": "CVCL_6872"}, {"title": "Targeting PDZ binding kinase is anti tumorigenic in novel preclinical models of

FAs  needed for rapid cell proliferation  We found Pin1 expression levels to correlate positively with ACC1 levels in human prostate cancers  and we focused on the relationship between Pin1 and ACC1  Notably  it was demonstrated that Pin1 associates with ACC1 but not with acetyl CoA carboxylase 2  ACC2  in the overexpression system as well as endogenously in the prostate cancer cell line DU145  This association is mediated by the WW domain in the Pin1 and C terminal domains of ACC1  Interestingly  Pin1 deficiency or treatment with Pin1 siRNA or the inhibitor juglone markedly reduced ACC1 protein expression without affecting  its mRNA level  while Pin1 overexpression increased the ACC1 protein level  In addition  chloroquine treatment restored the levels of ACC1 protein reduced by Pin1

it is likely that the growth enhancing effect of Pin1 in cancer cells is mediated at least partially by the stabilization of ACC1 protein  corresponding to the well known potential of Pin1 inhibitors

reported to possess significant anti tumor activities both in vitro and in vivo  The present  study was to investigate the effects of quercetin on growth and apoptosis in human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma  ACC   The result from MTT assay showed that quercetin decreased cell viability of both low metastatic cell line ACC 2 and high metastatic cell line ACC M in a concentration  and time dependent manner  Moreover  treatment with quercetin resulted in significantly increased apoptosis in ACC cells  Our data also revealed that the apoptosis induced by quercetin treatment was through a mitochondria dependent pathway which showed close correlation with the down regulation of the PI3K Akt IKK alpha NF kappaB pathway  Most importantly  quercetin significantly prevented in vivo growth of ACC xenografts in nude mice  accompanied by induction of tumor cell apoptosis  suppression of NF kappaB nuclear translocation  as well as down regulation of Akt and IKK alpha activation  In addition  we explored the clinical significance of the PI3K Akt IKK alpha NF kappaB signaling axis in ACC by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue specimens followed by the clustering analyses  We determined that the PI3K Akt IKK alpha NF kappaB pathway is ubiquitously activated in ACC and plays an essential role in the evasion of apoptosis  Taken together  the results from our study implicated that quercetin would be a promising chemotherapeutic agent against ACC through its function of down regulating the PI3K Akt IKK alpha NF kappaB signaling pathway", "cell_id": "CVCL_6872"}, {"title":

proliferating character of ACC 2 cells  The expression of CD44    and CD24    of  ACC 2 cells were investigated by immunohistochemical  Immunomagnetic isolation of different phenotype of ACC 2 cells  followed by cell culture  was used to study the proliferating abilities of different clusters of the cell line  The hetero transplanted tumor mold was established using BALB C nude mice by

cell behavior and tumor aggressiveness in many tissues  In this study  our goal was to determine the potential role of Id proteins  particularly Id1  during human SGC cell progression  METHODS: We first determined the expression levels of Id1 and Id2 in four SGC cell lines: two adenocarcinoma of the salivary gland  HSG and HSY  and two adenoid cystic carcinoma  ACC2 and ACCM  cell lines  We then used constructs that expressed antisense cDNAs to Id1 or Id2 to knockdown the expression of these proteins in cell lines where they were highly expressed  and determined the effects of the knockdown on cell proliferation  migration and invasion  RESULTS: Id1 mRNA and protein were detectable in all cell lines  and expression of Id2 was variable  from absent to high  The ACC2 and ACCM cell lines expressed  both Id1 and Id2  but Id1 was expressed at a higher level in the more aggressive  ACCM cell line in comparison to ACC2 cells as confirmed by Id1 promoter reporter  assays  We therefore focused on the ACCM cells for the remainder of the study  We found that proliferation and invasiveness of ACCM cells were strongly reduced after Id1 knockdown whereas Id2 suppression had only a slight effect  Results of  scratch and colony formation assays also confirmed that ACCM cell aggressiveness  was significantly reduced upon Id1 knockdown  Finally  this knockdown resulted in reduced c myc and enhanced cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 expression  CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that Id1 plays an important role in the control of human SGC cell aggressiveness and suggest a potential role as a marker of diagnosis  prognosis and progression of SGCs  Id1 suppression could represent  a novel and effective approach for the treatment of salivary gland cancer",
