by combination of drugs or a conjugated molecule associating  non steroidal anti inflammatory and nitric oxide donor effects in medullary thyroid cancer models: implication of the tumor suppressor p73

previously observed that two non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  NSAID   indomethacin  celecoxib  and nitric oxide  NO  prevented tumor growth in a model of human MTC cell line  TT  in nude mice  METHODS: In the present study  we tested the NO donor: glyceryl trinitrate  GTN   at pharmacological dose  alone and in combination with each of the two NSAIDs on  TT cells  We also assessed the anti proliferative potential of NO indomethacin  an indomethacin molecule chemically conjugated with a NO moiety  NCX 530  Nicox SA  on TT cells and indomethacin GTN association in rMTC 6 23 cells  The anti tumoral action of the combined sc  injections of GTN with oral delivery of indomethacin was also studied on subcutaneous TT tumors in nude mice  Apoptosis mechanisms were assessed by expression of caspase 3  TAp73\u03b1  TAp73\u03b1 inhibition by siRNA or Annexin V externalisation  RESULTS: The two NSAIDs and GTN reduced mitotic activity in TT cells versus control  cell number and PCNA protein expression   The combined treatments amplified the anti tumor effect of single agents in the two tested cell lines and promoted cell death  Moreover  indomethacin GTN association stopped the growth of established TT tumors in nude mice  We observed a significant cleavage of full length PARP  a caspase 3 substrate  The cell death appearance was correlated with a two fold increase in TAp73\u03b1 expression  with inhibition of apoptosis after TAp73\u03b1 siRNA addition  demonstrating its crucial role in apoptosis  CONCLUSION: Association of NO with NSAID exhibited amplified anti tumoral effects on in vitro and in vivo MTC models by inducing p73 dependent apoptotic cell death", "cell_id": "CVCL_7003"}, {"title": "TLQP Peptides in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Possible Blood

anticancer properties of Allium bakhtiaricum extracts  METHODS: Anti growth activity of different fractions was explored in vitro on different cancerous cells using MTT assay  Annexin V PI and SA \u03b2 gal staining  Western blotting  flowcytometric and immunofluorescence microscopic evaluations   In vivo antitumor activity was investigated in BALB c mice bearing 4\u2009T1 mammary carcinoma

values of 0 005 and 0 006\u2009mg ml  respectively  Incubation of MDA MB 231 cells with \u00bc and \u00bd IC50 72h concentrations of each fraction resulted in a significant G2 M cell cycle arrest  \u00bc IC50 72h concentration of the chloroform fraction led to the disruption of polymerization  in mitotic microtubules  Exposure of human breast cancer cells to different concentrations of the

gene using siRNA expression vector to reverse drug resistance in a human uterine sarcoma cell line OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy is highly effective in treating a number of gynecologic malignancies; however  its effectiveness diminishes with repeated exposures due to the emergence of multi drug resistance  MDR   The aim of this study was to establish a permanent MDR gene knockdown model via infection with the siRNA hairpin expression vector  The impact of transfecting the RNAi upon MDR 1 mRNA and P glycoprotein expression as well as resultant chemotherapy resistance was assessed  METHODS: Multi drug resistant cell line MES SA DX5 was transfected with the siRNA hairpin expression vector  pSMDR HYG  designed to target MDR 1 mRNA  A negative control was established utilizing a vector lacking the anti sense component  pSCON HYG   The LD 50  of doxorubicin for the stable transfectants was determined utilizing a cytotoxic MTT assay  The mRNA expression of MDR 1 gene among those cell lines was evaluated by semi quantitative RT PCR  The product of  P glycoprotein  P gp  was examined by Western blotting hybridization and immunostaining  RESULTS: Two stable transfected cell lines: MES SA DX5 M  with pSMDR HYG  and MES SA DX5 C  with pSCON HYG  were established  The cell line MES SA DX5 M was nearly 7 times more sensitive to doxorubicin than MES SA DX5 C and its parent cell line MES SA DX5  P   0 01   The mRNA expression of the MDR 1 gene in MES SA DX5 M was also statistically significantly lower than in the other 2 cell  lines  P   0 01  as assessed by semi quantitative RT PCR  A barely detectable signal for P gp  170 kDa  was observed in MES SA DX5 M  The vast majority of MES SA DX5 M cells were immunohistochemically negative for P gp  CONCLUSIONS: Stable  sequence specific MDR 1 gene silencing can be demonstrated by inducing the endogenous expression of hairpin siRNA  Hairpin siRNA based MDR 1 gene silencing correlated with decreased levels of MDR 1 mRNA and P gp

luciferase reporter assay and western blotting were used to assess the influence of genistein on cellular signaling; DNA fragmentation was assessed as a measure of genistein induced apoptosis  RESULTS: Genistein inhibited the proliferation of all three cell lines  with half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 19 2 \u03bcM  13 1 \u03bcM and 9 3 \u03bcM for SK UT 1  MES SA Dx5  and MES SA  respectively  This inhibitory activity was accompanied by induction of DNA fragmentation at 48 h  Western blot analyses revealed three major expression patterns: induction of p53 and Dickkopf related protein 1  DKK1  and suppression of histone deacetylase 4 5 7  HDAC4 5 7   dishevelled protein  DVL   BAX  survivin and phosphorylated mitogen activated protein kinase kinase  phospho MEK  in all

dimethylthiazol 2 yl  2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay  HepG2 cells were treated with SA at concentration ranges of 25  50  and 100 \u00b5M for 24 h  Reactive oxygen species  ROS  expression was investigated by dichlorofluorescein  staining assay  Morphological changes of SA treated HepG2 cells were evaluated by acridine orange  AO  and ethidium bromide  EB  dual staining  Apoptotic marker gene expressions were evaluated by qPCR  SA treatment caused significant cytotoxicity and liberation of ROS in HepG2 cells  AO and EB staining showed membrane blebbing and distortion in SA treated cells  Apoptotic markers such as caspases 3 and 9  cytochrome c  Apaf 1  Bax  and p53 gene expressions were significantly increased upon SA treatment indicating the possibility of apoptosis induction in HepG2 cells  This treatment also caused significant downregulation of Bcl 2 gene expression  SA has a cytotoxic effect on human HepG2 cell line  and this might be a promising agent in anticancer

of its target enzyme  topoisomerase II  Topo II   and the multidrug resistant phenotypes encoded by the mdr1 and MRP  multidrug resistance associated protein  genes  There is little information regarding the distribution  frequency  and origin of these mechanisms in cancer cells  PURPOSE: We performed fluctuation analysis experiments with the human sarcoma cell line  MES SA  to assess 1  if selection or induction mechanisms are involved in resistance to etoposide  2  mutation rates for cellular resistance to etoposide  and 3  the nature of the single step selected surviving clones  METHODS: Three groups of 10 flasks were seeded with more than 2000 cells each and allowed to grow to near confluence  approximately 3 x 10 6  cells per flask   After reseeding  each group received etoposide for 1 week at a final concentration of 0 5 microM  group A   1 0 microM  group B   and 5 0 microM  group C   Surviving colonies in each of the 30 populations were scored and individually harvested  RESULTS: Mutation rates were estimated at 2 9 x 10  6   group A   5 7 x 10  7   group B   and 1 7 x 10  7   group C  per cell generation  Of 61 propagated colonies  four of 26 from group A  five of 19 from group B  and none of 16 from group C were stably resistant  Analysis of variance supported the hypothesis of spontaneous mutations rather than induction  conferring etoposide resistance in groups A and B  Five of the stably resistant clones were cross resistant to doxorubicin  Analysis by polymerase chain reaction failed to detect the expression of the multidrug resistant gene mdr1 messenger RNA  mRNA  in any of the clones  No increase in expression of the MRP gene was observed  However  a significant decrease in both Topo II alpha and II beta mRNA  30  70   was found in six of seven stably resistant and six of six unstably resistant mutants  CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that resistance to etoposide arises spontaneously  with most clones surviving either stochastically or through very labile mechanisms of resistance  The experimental design has derived a set of resistant mutants from a single step selection  In those clones  decreased expression of Topo II is the predominant mechanism selected  IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that stable resistance to etoposide chemotherapy may be acquired by selection of spontaneously arising mutants rather than induction by drug exposure  The stably resistant clones may represent descendants from a single mutational event in each population", "cell_id": "CVCL_7003"}, {"title": "Complement fixing

hexyl ALA PDT induced signal transduction proteins and mode of cell death were quantitated by CASE ELISA assays and DAPI staining  The modulation of hTERT mRNA expression and  telomerase activity were investigated by TaqMan real time PCR and ELISA respectively  Hexyl ALA PDT mediated cell migratory effect was determined by wound healing assay  RESULTS: The results demonstrated that mitochondria

polymeric micelles targeting delivery for integrin overexpressing tumor cells", "index": "PMID:22282676", "document": "RGD peptide mediated chitosan based polymeric micelles targeting delivery for integrin overexpressing tumor cells BACKGROUND: Solid tumors need new blood vessels to feed and nourish them as well  as to allow tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs  which is termed \"angiogenesis \" Some tumor cells within solid tumors can overexpress integrins \u03b1 v \u03b2 3  and \u03b1 v \u03b2 5   which can specifically recognize the peptide motif Arg Gly Asp  RGD   Thus  the targeting of RGD modified micelles to  tumor vasculature is a promising strategy for tumor targeting treatment  METHODS: RGD peptide  GSSSGRGDSPA  was coupled to poly ethylene glycol  modified  stearic acid grafted chitosan  PEG CS SA  micelles via chemical reaction in the presence of N N' Disuccinimidyl carbonate  The critical micelle concentration of  the polymeric micelles was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity of  pyrene as a fluorescent probe  The micelle size  size distribution  and zeta potential were measured by light scattering and electrophoretic mobility  Doxorubicin  DOX  was chosen as a model anticancer drug to investigate the drug entrapment efficiency  in vitro drug release profile  and in vitro antitumor activities of drug loaded RGD PEG CS SA micelles in cells that overexpress integrins  \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 3  and \u03b1 \u03bd \u03b2 5   and integrin deficient cells  RESULTS: Using DOX as a model drug  the drug encapsulation efficiency could reach 90   and the in vitro drug release profiles suggested that the micelles could be  used as a controlled release carrier for the hydrophobic drug  Qualitative and quantitative analysis of cellular uptake indicated that RGD modified micelles could significantly increase the DOX concentration in integrin overexpressing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line  BEL 7402   but not in human epithelial  carcinoma cell line  Hela   The competitive cellular uptake test showed that the  cellular uptake of RGD modified micelles in BEL 7402 cells was significantly inhibited in the presence of excess free RGD peptides  In vitro cytotoxicity tests demonstrated DOX loaded RGD modified micelles could specifically enhance the cytotoxicity against BEL 7402 compared with DOX loaded PEG CS SA and doxorubicin hydrochlorate  CONCLUSION: This study suggests that RGD modified PEG CS SA micelles are promising drug carriers for integrin overexpressing tumor active

antigens encapsulated in biodegradable polymeric particles have been shown to sustain antigen release and provide long term protection against tumor challenge by improving the immune response towards the antigen  Treatment of mice with cancer vaccines based on different polyanhydride copolymers encapsulating OVA resulted in stimulation of tumor specific immune responses with different magnitudes  This clearly indicates that polyanhydride chemistry plays a substantial role in stimulating the immune response  Vaccination with 20:80 CPTEG:CPH OVA  the most hydrophobic formulation  stimulated the strongest cellular and humoral immune responses and provided the longest survival outcome without adding any other adjuvant  The most important finding in this study is that the copolymer composition

these fundamental questions through investigation of the genetic and epigenetic pathways that control the origin of ABCB1  MDR1  gene activation with acquired multidrug resistance in drug sensitive human sarcoma  MES SA cells   The genetic and epigenetic bases of this selected activation involve the initiation of transcription at a site 112 kb upstream of the ABCB1 proximal promoter  P1  in the

These alterations provide both genetic and epigenetic susceptibility for ABCB1 expression in drug resistant cells  Complete activation of the ABCB1 gene through the coding region was proposed by interactions of selected trans alterations or epigenetic changes on the ABCB1 proximal promoter  which occurred during initial  drug exposure  Thus  our data provide evidence for a major genomic

inflammatory host responses between genetically distinct MERS CoV isolates BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus in the Middle East  designated MERS CoV  is a reminder of the zoonotic and pathogenic potential of emerging coronaviruses in humans  Clinical features of Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  include atypical pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure that is highly reminiscent of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  caused by  SARS CoV  The host response is a key component of highly pathogenic respiratory virus infection  Here  we computationally analyzed gene expression changes in a human airway epithelial cell line infected with two genetically distinct MERS CoV strains obtained from human patients  MERS CoV SA 1 and MERS CoV Eng 1  RESULTS: Using topological techniques  including persistence homology and filtered clustering  we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of human Calu 3 cell host responses to the different MERS CoV strains  with MERS CoV Eng 1 inducing early kinetic changes  between 3 and 12\u00a0hours post infection  compared to MERS CoV SA 1  Robust transcriptional changes distinguished the two MERS CoV strains predominantly at the late time points  Combining statistical analysis of  infection and cytokine stimulated Calu 3 transcriptomics  we identified differential innate responses  including up regulation of extracellular remodeling genes following MERS CoV Eng 1 infection and differential pro inflammatory responses  CONCLUSIONS: Through our genomics based approach  we found topological differences in the kinetics and magnitude of the host response to MERS CoV SA 1 and MERS CoV Eng 1  with differential expression of innate immune and pro inflammatory responsive genes as a result of IFN  TNF and IL 1\u03b1 signaling  Predicted activation for STAT3 mediating gene expression relevant for epithelial  cell to cell adherens and junction signaling in MERS CoV Eng 1 infection suggest  that these transcriptional differences may be the result of amino acid differences in viral proteins known to modulate innate immunity during MERS CoV infection", "cell_id": "CVCL_7003"}, {"title":

cell line models Background: Influenza virus can cause both seasonal infections and unpredictable  pandemics  Rapidly evolving avian H5N1 and \u00a0H7N9 viruses have a potential pandemic threat for humans  Since avian Influenza can be transmitted by domestic  birds  serving as a key link between wild birds and humans  an effective measure  to control the influenza transmission would be eradication of the infection in poultry  It is known that the virus penetrates into the cell through binding with the terminal oligosaccharides   sialic acids  SA    on the cell surfaces  Removal of SA might be a potential antiviral strategy  An approach to developing chicken  lines that are resistant to influenza viruses could be the creation of genetically modified birds  Thus it is necessary to select a gene that provides defense to influenza  Here we have expressed in cells a range of exogenous sialidases and estimated their activity and specificity towards SA residues  Methods: Several bacterial  viral and human sialidases were tested  We adopted bacterial sialidases from Salmonella and Actinomyces for expression on the cell surface by fusing catalytic domains with transmembrane domains  We also selected  Influenza A PuertoRico 8 34 H1N1 neuraminidase and human membrane sialidase   hNeu3  genes  Lectin binding assay was used for estimation of a \u03b1  2 3  sialylation level

Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that sialidases with different specificity and activity can be selected as genes providing antiviral defence  Combining chosen sialidases with different activity

"document": "NEDD8 mediated neddylation is required for human endometrial stromal proliferation and decidualization STUDY QUESTION: Does NEDD8 mediated neddylation regulate human endometrial stromal proliferation and decidualization? SUMMARY ANSWER: Neddylation inhibition by a selective NEDD8 activating enzyme inhibitor  MLN4924  significantly impairs human endometrial stromal cell  HESC  proliferation and decidualization and facilitates cell senescence  via p21 accumulation  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Neddylation regulates cell proliferation and tissue remodeling during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis  while human endometrial stroma undergoes sequential proliferation  differentiation  as well as dynamic tissue remodeling during each menstrual cycle  STUDY DESIGN  SIZE  DURATION: We first analyzed the expression of NEDD8 in human  endometrial tissues from 50 subjects  and then explored the consequence of neddylation inhibition by MLN4924 on HESCs proliferation  decidualization and cellular senescence  PARTICIPANTS MATERIALS  SETTING  METHODS: We collected 50 dated human endometrial tissues from early proliferative stage to late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and analyzed the NEDD8 expression and cellular location in human endometrium by employing quantitative real time PCR  qRT PCR  and immunohistochemistry staining  Similar approaches were also used to explore the mRNA and protein expression of NEDD8 in an immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line  HESC  during proliferation and decidualization  N   6   An MTS assay was performed to evaluate the effects of neddylation inhibition by MLN4924 on HESC proliferation  Flow cytometry and BrdU incorporation assay were conducted to determine the HESC cell cycle progression in response to MLN4924 exposure during  proliferation  We also analyzed F actin distribution by phalloidin staining and decidual marker gene expression by qRT PCR to accesses the consequence of neddylation inhibition on HESC decidualization  Immunoblotting analysis of cullin1 and p21  and SA \u03b2 Galactosidase staining were performed to reveal the potential molecular basis for the impaired HESC proliferation  decidualization and cellular senescence  The siRNA technique was applied to knockdown p21 expression to test whether a clearance of p21 accumulation would correct the HESC defects from neddylation inhibition  MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We demonstrated that NEDD8 is ubiquitously expressed in human endometrium including luminal epithelium  glandular epithelium and the stromal cells during the menstrual cycle  as well as in the HESCs during  proliferation and differentiation in culture  Employing multiple molecular  cellular and pharmacological approaches  we further observed that neddylation inhibition by MLN4924 significantly attenuates HESC proliferation  P value   0 05   impairs decidual transformation  P value   0 05   and facilitates cellular senescence  These abnormal HESC activities upon MLN4924 exposure were accompanied with reduced cullin1 neddylation and an aberrant accumulation of p21  While a clearance of p21 accumulation by siRNA knockdown could partially restore HESC proliferation and cellular viability  it failed to correct the decidualization defects  LIMITATIONS  REASONS FOR CAUTION: Since NEDD8 was also intensely expressed in the endometrial epithelium  it is interesting to further study its potential role in  stroma epithelial interactions through isolating and culturing epithelial cells   p21 siRNA knockdown experiments revealed that there are differential molecular machineries  other than p21  that are subject to neddylation regulation during HESC proliferation compared with differentiation  This alternative mechanism warrants further investigation in future  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings add novel evidence showing  for  what we believe the first time  that NEDD8 mediated neddylation is required for normal human endometrial functions  which raises the possibility of approaching the neddylation system for diagnosis and treatment of infertility in women  STUDY FUNDING COMPETING INTERESTS: This work was supported in parts by the

generation of reactive oxygen species  ROS  in a dose dependent  manner  In addition  western blot analysis revealed that SA enhances the phosphorylations of c Jun N terminal kinases  JNK  and activated protein 1  AP 1   These phosphorylations were inhibited by N acetylcysteine  NAC   an anti oxidant  Finally  SA induced AT1R expression was found to be prevented both  by NAC and specific JNK inhibitor  SP6001325  strongly indicating that AT1R upregulation is a result of the ROS mediated activation of the JNK signaling pathway  Taken together  our results indicate that arsenic indeed upregulates the AT1R expression  thus highlighting a role of arsenic induced aberrant AT1R signaling in the pathogenesis of hypertension", "cell_id": "CVCL_7003"}, {"title": "Circumvention of

toxins  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the augmentative property of SA on saporin and saporin based immunotoxins  IT  directed against five different cell surface target molecules on human leukemia and lymphoma cells  MATERIALS AND METHODS: After determining the optimum dose of SA for each cell line  the extent of SA mediated augmentation was established for saporin and five saporin based ITs using XTT and an annexin V apoptosis assay  Immunospecificity was investigated using three different blocking assays  Dose scheduling was also  investigated using the XTT assay  RESULTS: Uncorrected SA mediated augmentation ranged at best from 31 5 million fold to  at worse  174 fold  However  when the calculated fold increases  were adjusted for the non immunospecific effects of SA on an off target IT  the true augmentative effects of SA were found to be largely non immunospecific  Antibody blocking studies demonstrated that the augmentative effect of SA was only partially immunospecific  Separate exposure of target cells to IT and SA at  different times demonstrated that immunospecific augmentation of IT by SA could be achieved but only if cells were exposed to IT first and SA second  CONCLUSIONS: SA significantly  although variably  augments the cytotoxicity of saporin and saporin based immunotoxins  Concomitant exposure to both IT and SA can result in non immunospecific

present work aims at evaluating whether ASA could directly decrease cell glycolysis through inhibition of the major regulatory enzyme within this pathway  6 phosphofructo 1 kinase  PFK   We show that
