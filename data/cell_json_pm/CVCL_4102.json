poorly defined  In this study  we have evaluated whether Annexin A1 derived peptide Ac2 26 stimulates fibroblast migration in high glucose conditions  Using normal human skin fibroblasts WS1 in low glucose  LG  or high glucose  HG  we observed the enrichment of Annexin A1 protein at cell movement structures like lamellipodial extrusions and interestingly  a significant decrease in levels of the protein in HG conditions  The analysis of the translocation of Annexin A1 to cell membrane showed lower levels of Annexin A1 in both membrane pool and supernatants of WS1 cells treated with HG  Wound healing assays using cell line transfected with Annexin A1 siRNAs indicated a slowing down in migration speed of cells suggesting that Annexin A1 has a role in the migration of WS1 cells  In order to analyze the role of extracellular Annexin A1  in cell migration  we have performed wound healing assays using Ac2 26 showing that peptide was able to increase fibroblast cell migration in HG conditions  Experiments on the mobilization of intracellular calcium and analysis of p ERK expression confirmed the activity of the FPR1 following stimulation with the peptide Ac2 26  A wound healing assay on WS1 cells in the presence of the FPR agonist fMLP  of the FPR antagonist CsH and in the presence of Ac2 26 indicated that Annexin A1 influences fibroblast cell migration under HG conditions acting through FPR receptors whose expression was slightly increased in HG  In conclusion  these data demonstrate that  i  Annexin A1 is involved in migration of WS1 cells  through interaction with FPRs;  ii  N  terminal peptide of Annexin  A1 Ac2 26 is able to stimulate direct migration of WS1 cells in high glucose treatment possibly due to the increased receptor expression observed in

histologic subtype of lung cancer   with a strong predilection for metastasizing to brain early  However  the cellular and molecular basis is poorly known  Here  we provided evidence to reveal the role of annexin A1 in small cell lung cancer metastasis to brain  Firstly  the elevated annexin A1 serum levels in small cell lung cancer patients  were associated with brain metastasis  The levels of annexin A1 were also upregulated in NCI H446 cells  a small cell lung cancer cell line  upon migration into the mice brain  More interestingly  annexin A1 was secreted by NCI H446 cells in a time dependent manner when co culturing with human brain microvascular endothelial cells  which was identified with the detections of annexin A1 in the  co cultured cellular supernatants by ELISA and western blot  Further results showed that blockage of annexin A1 in the co cultured cellular supernatants using a neutralized antibody significantly inhibited NCI H446 cells adhesion to brain

prevented its transendothelial migration in vitro and metastasis to mice brain in vivo  Our data showed that small cell lung cancer cell in brain microvasculature microenvironment could express much

nonsense mediated decay and protein modulators with complementary mechanisms of action BACKGROUND: The nonsense mutation  c 3846G A  aka: W1282X CFTR  leads to a truncated transcript that is susceptible to nonsense mediated decay  NMD  and produces a shorter protein that is unstable and lacks normal channel activity in  patient derived tissues  However  if overexpressed in a heterologous expression system  the truncated mutant protein has been shown to mediate CFTR channel function following the addition of potentiators  In this study  we asked if a quadruple combination of small molecules that together inhibit nonsense mediated  decay  stabilize both halves of the mutant protein and potentiate CFTR channel activity could rescue the functional expression of W1282X CFTR in patient derived nasal cultures  METHODS: We identified the CFTR domains stabilized by corrector compounds supplied from AbbVie using a fragment based  biochemical approach  Rescue of the  channel function of W1282X  CFTR protein by NMD inhibition and small molecule protein modulators was studied using a bronchial cell line engineered to express  W1282X and in primary nasal epithelial cultures derived from four patients homozygous for this mutation  RESULTS: We confirmed previous studies showing that inhibition of NMD using the inhibitor: SMG1i  led to an increased abundance of the shorter transcript in a bronchial cell line  Interestingly  on top of SMG1i  treatment with a combination of two new correctors developed by Galapagos AbbVie  AC1 and AC2 2  separately targeting either the first or second half of CFTR and promoting assembly  significantly increased the potentiated channel activity by the mutant in the bronchial epithelial cell line and in patient derived nasal epithelial cultures   The average rescue effect in primary cultures was approximately 50  of the regulated chloride conductance measured in non CF cultures  CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide the first in vitro evidence in patient derived airway cultures that the functional defects incurred by W1282X  has the potential to be effectively repaired pharmacologically", "cell_id": "CVCL_4102"},

HT6 receptor in a CHODUKX cell line INTRODUCTION: The generation and selection of recombinant cell lines specifically designed to express high picomolar levels of heterologous G protein coupled receptors can lead to loss of ligand dependent functional activity  As a result   the clonal selection of a suitable host model and or lower receptor expression levels within the same cell system becomes important especially when a functional assay is necessary to evaluate the pharmacological potencies of ligands at the receptor site  To address this question  we examined the utility of various signal transducers to restore the functional capacity of a high expressing human  5 HT 6  receptor CHODUKX system  METHODS: The plasmids for human 5 HT 6  receptor and full length human G s   G olf  and rat adenylyl cyclase isoforms 2  rAC2  and 5 were obtained by PCR  The h5 HT 6  receptor pHTop plasmid was stably transfected into a CHODUKX cell line to generate an h5 HT 6  expressing

 RESULTS: The h5 HT 6  receptor CHODUKX line was a high receptor expressor   2 pmol mg protein  but an extremely poor ligand dependent functional responder  failing to produce the appropriate cAMP signal upon addition of selective agonists  We found that stable co expression of rAC2 with h5 HT 6  receptor in the CHODUKX cell line displayed dose dependent cAMP accumulation following agonist

restoration of functional capacity in a heterologous G s  coupled 5 HT 6  AC2 CHODUKX expression system  We discuss the broader value of a stable AC2 expressing CHODUKX cell line in which the
