"Cytotoxic activity of the chemical constituents of Clerodendrum indicum and Clerodendrum villosum roots OBJECTIVE: The roots of two Thai medicinal plants  Clerodendrum indicum and Clerodendrum villosum are found in traditional medicine practices  The aim of this research was to preliminarily study the cytotoxicity of extracts of their roots  and the parts that possessed cytotoxic activity were separated on a chromatograph to identify their active compounds  METHODS: The extracts of both plants were screened for cytotoxicity on the SW620  cell line and the compounds isolated from the active extracts were further evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against five human cancer cell lines  including SW620  ChaGo K 1  HepG2  KATO III and BT 474 using the 3  4 5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl  2 5 diphenyl 2 H tetrazolium bromide  MTT  assay  RESULTS: Dichloromethane extracts of C  indicum and C  villosum were active against the SW620 cell line  Triterpenoids were mostly obtained from the extracts of these plants  0 28  and 1 02   respectively  and exhibited varying degrees of  cytotoxicity and specificity against the tested cell lines  Two triterpenoids  oleanolic acid 3 acetate and betulinic acid  displayed moderate to strong cytotoxicity toward all cancer cell lines  with 50  inhibitory concentration  IC50  values of 1 66 20 49\u202f\u00b5mol L  whereas 3\u03b2 hydroxy D:B friedo olean 5 ene and taraxerol were cytotoxic to only the SW620 cell line  IC50\u202f \u202f23 39 and 2 09\u202f\u00b5mol L  respectively   Triterpenoid  lupeol  showed potent cytotoxicity on both SW620  IC50\u202f \u202f1 99\u202f\u00b5mol L  and KATO III cell lines  IC50\u202f \u202f1 95\u202f\u00b5mol L   while a flavonoid  pectolinarigenin  displayed moderate cytotoxicity against these cells  IC50\u202f \u202f13 05 and 24 31\u202f\u00b5mol L  respectively   Although the widely distributed steroid  stigmasterol  was effective against the SW620 cell line  IC50\u202f \u202f2 79\u202f\u00b5mol L  and \u03b2 sitosterol was also active against SW620  IC50\u202f \u202f11 26\u202f\u00b5mol L   BT 474  IC50\u202f \u202f14 11\u202f\u00b5mol L  and HepG2 cancer cells  IC50\u202f \u202f20 47\u202f\u00b5mol L   none of the characteristic 24\u03b2 ethylsteroids of either Clerodendrum species were shown to be cytotoxic  CONCLUSION: This study is the first report on the presence of cytotoxic triterpenoids from the roots of these medicinal plants  which have been used in herbal formulas as an antipyretic  Our findings support further in depth study of this pharmacological

MUC 2 and MUC 3  and one breast cancer mucin  MUC 1   Specific core mucin proteins were confirmed  by immunoblots using antibodies that recognize MUC 1  MUC 2  and MUC 3 core peptides  These experiments demonstrate that all cell lines contained HMG in the  medium  cytosol  and membrane fractions  The HMG was mucinous in breast  pancreatic  and lung cell lines  In contrast  most of the HMG secreted by the gastric cell line was proteoglycan like  due to its susceptibility to hyaluronidase  heparinase  and chondroitinase avidin biotin complex  Ion exchange  DEAE Sephacel  chromatography of  3H glucosamine labeled HMG demonstrated that the acidic or basic nature of the mucin was different in all cancer cell lines tested  Despite these differences  mRNA and immunoblot analysis suggest that all  cell lines predominantly express MUC 1 apomucin  small amounts of MUC 2 apomucin  and no MUC 3  Immunoprecipitation of MUC 1 type mucin using the 139H2 monoclonal  antibody demonstrated that different sizes of mucin peptides were present in all  cell lines  corresponding to the known length polymorphism of this mucin  The amount and nature of carbohydrate epitopes were analyzed by immunoblots using anti T  peanut lectin   anti Tn  91S8 monoclonal antibody   and anti sialosyl Tn   JT10e monoclonal antibody   T and Tn antigens were significantly higher in breast and pancreatic

inducible 153  GADD153  gene  in human lung cancer cell line PC 9: Cotreatment with EGCG plus celecoxib strongly induced the expression of both GADD153 mRNA level and protein in PC 9 cells  while neither EGCG nor celecoxib alone did  However  cotreatment did not induce expression of other apoptosis related genes  p21 WAF1  and GADD45  Judging by upregulation of GADD153  only cotreatment with EGCG plus celecoxib synergistically induced apoptosis of PC 9 cells  Synergistic effects with the combination were also observed in 2 other lung cancer cell lines  A549 and ChaGo  K 1  Furthermore  EGCG did not enhance GADD153 gene expression or apoptosis induction in PC 9 cells in combination with N  4 hydroxyphenyl retinamide or with aspirin  Thus  upregulation of GADD153 is closely correlated with synergistic enhancement of apoptosis with EGCG  Cotreatment also activated the mitogen activated protein kinases  MAPKs   such as ERK1 2 and p38 MAPK: Preteatment with PD98059  ERK1 2 inhibitor  and UO126  selective MEK inhibitor  abrogated both upregulation of GADD153 and synergistic induction of apoptosis of  PC 9 cells  while SB203580  p38 MAPK inhibitor  did not do so  indicating that GADD153 expression was mediated through the ERK signaling pathway  These findings indicate that high upregulation of GADD153 is a key requirement for cancer prevention in combination with EGCG",

findings provide evidence of a retinoid signaling alteration involving AP 1 in tumorigenic 11701 and NSCLC cells  Furthermore  the  inhibitory effect of t RA on AP 1 transcriptional activity was not

modeling of the GR structure in this region of the hormone binding domain and molecular dynamic simulations suggested that the GRV575M mutation would have a decreased affinity for the LXXLL motif of
