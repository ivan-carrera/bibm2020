in vitro model of human corneal epithelial cells  The nature of this cell line was assessed for genomic aberrations and cellular heterogeneity  METHODS: For the quantitative measurement of genomic aberrations  array based comparative genomic hybridization  CGH  analysis was performed  For identification of cellular heterogeneity  cell morphology  growth kinetics  transepithelial electrical resistance  and transfection transcriptional efficiency were analyzed  Real time PCR and chromosomal fluorescent in situ hybridization  cFISH  against some gained or lost loci were performed  to

METHODS: HCE T cells  40 50  confluent   which possess the biochemical and morphological phenotype of human corneal epithelial cells  were treated with either TGF beta 1   20 ng ml  or EGF  20 ng ml  for 0  24  48  and 72 h  Total RNA was isolated at each time point from the treated cells and the placebo treated controls  The TGFBI mRNA transcript level was quantitated using Northern blot analysis  RESULTS: TGF beta 1  upregulates TGFBI gene transcript in this human corneal epithelial cell line  reaching a peak of 2 5 fold of upregulation at 48 h after TGF beta 1  treatment and a 1 5 fold at 72 h  In contrast  EGF treatment showed no effect on the TGFBI mRNA level  In addition  the TGFBI gene transcript appears to be cell density dependent because the transcript level shows a trend of reduction as the cell density increases from 40 50  to full confluency  CONCLUSION: The TGFBI gene transcript in this human corneal epithelial cell line  is upregulated by growth factor TGF beta  1   but is not affected by growth factor EGF  Furthermore  cell density appears to be an important regulatory mechanism in controlling the level of TGFBI gene expression in corneal epithelial cells",

of corneal epithelial cell interaction  with laminin isoforms was analyzed using immunofluorescence microscopy and adhesion assays incorporating functional blocking antibodies  RESULTS: In short term

IMCnano eye drops was significantly greater than  in the case of the commercially available IMC eye drops in both in vivo and in vitro studies using rabbit corneas  Taken together  we hypothesize that a nanoparticle formulation reduces the corneal toxicity of IMC eye drops  probably  because the accumulation of IMC from IMCnano eye drops in the eye is lower than that from commercially available IMC eye drops  In addition  the nanoparticle formulation may allow a decrease in the amount of IMC used due to the increase in bioavailability  resulting in reduced drug toxicity  These findings provide significant information that can be used to design further studies aimed at developing less toxic eye drops", "cell_id": "CVCL_6341"}, {"title": "Human corneal epithelial cells express functional PAR

and  2 mRNAs was determined by RT PCR in cultured primary human corneal epithelial cells  HCECs  and the human corneal epithelial cell line HCE T  Localization of PAR 1 and  2 in whole normal human corneas was determined by immunofluorescence with PAR 1 and  2 antibodies  The functional competence of PAR 1 and  2 in corneal epithelial cells was assessed by measuring  the rapid induction of intracellular  Ca 2    in response to thrombin  trypsin  and specific receptor activating peptides derived from the tethered ligands of the PAR receptors  HCE T expression of cytokines  IL 6  IL 8  and TNFalpha  in response to activation of PAR 1 and  2 was measured by quantitative RT PCR and ELISA  RESULTS: Functional PAR 1 and  2 were expressed in both HCECs and HCE T cells  Immunoreactivity for PAR 1 and  2 was detected in the outer epithelial layer of the cornea in whole human corneal sections  Activation of PAR 1 and  2 led to upregulation in HCE T cells of both expression of mRNA and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL 6  IL 8  and TNFalpha  CONCLUSIONS: The results show for the first time that functional PAR 1 and  2 are present in human cornea  Activation of these

listed irritants at a concentration  range of 10 100 microM  Cell viability and northern blot analysis were performed  following a 24 and 48 hr incubation period  RESULTS: HCE T cells expressed HO 1 mRNA and HO activity similar to other human cell lines  Northern blot analysis demonstrated that levels of HO 1 mRNA transcripts increased regularly after exposure to the irritants in a concentration dependent manner  Studies on the effect of various inhibitors and inducers of HO 1 on cell viability showed that inhibition of HO 1 potentiates the cytotoxic effect of ocular irritants  In contrast  pre induction of HO 1 in HCE T decreases the effect of various irritants on cell viability  CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the idea that HO 1 mRNA levels may be used as an indicator of toxicity resulting from ocular irritants and that HCE T cells respond to stress in a fashion similar to other human cell lines  This strategy for testing may be important in the development of an alternative to Draize testing  The results of this study also suggest that HO 1 may constitute a part of the protective defense mechanism against chemical injury", "cell_id": "CVCL_6341"}, {"title":

cells  longer incubation of the cells after exposure resulted in recovery or upregulation only of the Nalp sensors  At the protein level  we detected a short  isoform of Nalp1 and its expression

wounds were monitored using a  fundus camera TRC 50X equipped with a digital camera; eye drops were instilled into rat eyes five times a day after corneal epithelial abrasion  The viability of HCE T

commercially available timolol maleate eye drops containing 0 5  mannitol was significantly higher than that for eyes instilled with timolol maleate eye drops without mannitol  and the addition of mannitol did not affect the corneal penetration or IOP reducing effect of the timolol maleate eye drops  A preservative system comprising BAC and mannitol may  provide effective therapy for glaucoma

"Expression of ABC transporters in human corneal tissue and the transformed cell line  HCE T PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to elucidate the expression pattern of transport proteins relevant to drug absorption in human cornea and to assess the  human corneal epithelial cell line  HCE T  regarding its use as an in vitro model for drug absorption studies  METHODS: Human corneal tissue and HCE T cells were examined for the expression of P glycoprotein  P gp MDR1   multidrug resistance associated protein 1  MRP1   multidrug resistance associated protein 2  MRP2   lung resistance related protein  LRP   and breast cancer resistance protein  BCRP   using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence microscopy  Moreover  transporter activity was measured by bi directional flux studies across excised human cornea and HCE T cell layers using a P gp MDR1 substrate  rhodamine 123  Rh123   RESULTS: Transport studies of Rh123 revealed no significant differences in fluxes in the apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical directions across excised  human corneas or HCE T cell layers  suggesting the absence or insignificant  if any  participation of P gp MDR1 to Rh123 fluxes  Of all the transporter proteins  under investigation  only LRP was found in human cornea  By contrast  a signal for LRP was not found in HCE T  but the expression of MRP1  MRP2  and BCRP could  be confirmed  Of note is the lack of P gp MDR1 expression in any of the specimens we examined  CONCLUSIONS: Only a limited array of ABC transporters is functionally expressed in human cornea  The expression pattern of HCE T cells appears to be widely different from that of the native corneal tissue  Hence  the in vitro model of human cornea  HCE T  should be used with much caution

Corneal epithelial cell densities were evaluated histologically  RS9 and RTA 402 induced the expression of NQO1 and GCLC mRNAs in HCE T cells  And both compounds suppressed hyperosmotic ROS generation and menadione induced cellular damage  However RS9 had a stronger protective effect than RTA 402  Ocular instillation of RS9 also significantly upregulated the expression of Nqo1 mRNA in the corneal epithelium   Accumulation of 8 OHdG  increase of SPK scores and decrement of basal cell density were observed in corneal epithelium from scopolamine injected rats  These changes were significantly ameliorated by the topical administration of RS9  RS9  induced Nfe2l2 activation and Nfe2l2 targeted genes  reduced oxidation  and ameliorated symptoms of dry eye using in vitro and in vivo models
