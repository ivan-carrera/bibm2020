phosphate receptor in vivo Phosphomannosyl residues on lysosomal enzymes serve as an essential component of  the recognition marker necessary for binding to the mannose 6 phosphate  Man 6 P  receptor and translocation to lysosomes  The high mannose type oligosaccharide units of lysosomal enzymes are phosphorylated by the following mechanism: N acetylglucosamine 1 phosphate is transferred to the 6 position of a mannose residue to form a phosphodiester; then N  acetylglucosamine is removed to expose  a phosphomonoester  We examined the kinetics of this phosphorylation pathway in the murine lymphoma BW5147 3 cell line to determine the state of oligosaccharide  phosphorylation at the time the newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes bind to the receptor  Cells were labeled with  2  3 H mannose for 20 min and then chased for  various times up to 4 h  The binding of newly synthesized glycoproteins to the Man 6 P receptor was followed by eluting the bound ligand with Man 6 P  Receptor bound material was first detected at 30 min of chase and reached a maximum at 60 min of chase  at which time approximately 10 percent of the total phosphorylated oligosaccharides were associated with the receptor  During longer  chase times  the total quantity of cellular phosphorylated oligosaccharides decreased with a half time of 1 4 h  suggesting that the lysosomal enzymes had reached their destination and had been dephosphorylated  The structures of the phosphorylated aligosaccharides of the eluted ligand were then determined and compared with the phosphorylated oligosaccharides of molecules which were not bond to the receptor  The major phosphorylated oligosaccharide species present in the nonreceptor bound material contained a single phosphosphodiester at all time  examined  In contrast  receptor bound oligosaccharides were greatly enriched in species possessing one and two phosphomonoesters  These results indicate that binding of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to the Man 6 P receptor occurs only after removal of the covering N  acetylglucosamine residues", "cell_id": "CVCL_3896"}, {"title": "The distribution of repeating  Gal beta 1 4GlcNAc beta 1 3  sequences

MStF was TCA soluble  thermoresistant  highly hydrophobic and protease resistant  but activity was abolished by neuraminidase digestion  The possibility of its being a small molecule transported by a

locomotor status of leukocytes is usually assessed on the basis of static information  by counting the number of spherical versus non spherical cells  In this paper we describe two methods for the measurement of shape changes in microscopic images of lymphoid cells  First we computed a simple shape change factor  coined incongruence factor  based on the degree of non overlap of the contours of

into sinusoidal 'waves' of increasing frequency  each with its corresponding amplitude  The amplitude values for the first ten frequencies produced a satisfactory mathematical description of lymphoid cell shapes  and the change of these amplitudes over a 1 minute time interval produced a quantitative description of the shape alterations of the cells  We have used five approaches to evaluate the

the mechanism of action  the effects of both on the level of intracellular cAMP  protein kinase C activity and calcium influx were studied  Moreover  the NDGA present in the aqueous extract of the plant was quantified  The aqueous extract and the standard NDGA showed antiproliferative action against these cells  While the antiproliferative activity of the aqueous extract was mediated by an increase in cAMP levels  and inhibition of PKC and calcium influx  the antiproliferative activity of NDGA was related only to the inhibition of PKC  Considering the amount of NDGA detected in the

prostaglandin E2  PGE2  and the steroid hormone progesterone  both known to be secreted by GRMO1V cells  stimulated the migration of BW 14 cells  indicating that the stimulatory effect of the

 The proliferation of BW 14 cells  on the other hand was  depending on the dilution used  stimulated or inhibited by GRMO1V conditioned medium  Our findings indicate that the differential capacity of

Ly 6A E mediated T cell  activation Ly 6E  a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol  GPI  anchored murine alloantigen that can activate T cells upon antibody cross linking  has been converted into an integral membrane protein by gene fusion  This fusion product  designated Ly 6EDb  was characterized in transiently transfected COS cells and demonstrated to be an integral cell surface membrane protein  Furthermore  the fusion antigen can be expressed on the surface of the BW5147 class \"E\" mutant cell line  which only expresses integral membrane proteins but not GPI anchored proteins  The capability of this fusion antigen to activate T cells was examined by gene transfer studies in D10G4 1  a type 2 T cell helper clones  When transfected into D10 cells  the GPI anchored Ly 6E antigen  as well as the endogenous GPI anchored Ly 6A antigen  can initiate T cell activation upon antibody cross linking  In contrast  the transmembrane anchored Ly 6EDb antigen was unable to mediate T cell activation  Our results demonstrate that the GPI anchor is critical to Ly 6A E mediated T cell activation", "cell_id": "CVCL_3896"}, {"title": "T cell regulation of collagen induced arthritis in mice

with CII and type IX collagen  Both hybridomas recognized CII pulsed targets in association with H 2Kq molecules  These data indicate that the two CII specific cytotoxic clones recognize different
