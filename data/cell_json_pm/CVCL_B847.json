L Carnitine Transport System in Murine Photoreceptor Cell  Line While it is well known that L carnitine  3 hydroxy 4  trimethylazaniumyl  butanoate  is an essential molecule for \u03b2 oxidation  it provides anti oxidative effects as well  Since these effects have been observed in photoreceptor cells  the carnitine's intracellular concentration is considered to play a protective role against oxidative damage to those cells   However  even though its high hydrophilicity makes it likely that carnitine import is accomplished via a dedicated host transport system  the specific uptake process into those cells is currently unknown  Therefore  in this study  we sought to identify and characterize photoreceptor cell carnitine uptake transporter s  utilizing 661W cells as a photoreceptor cell model  The results of our uptake assays showed that carnitine was transported into 661W cells in a saturable manner  Km 5 5\u2009mM   and that the activity was susceptible to extracellular pH and Na   While these data suggest the involvement of a transporter in 661W cell carnitine uptake  the observed transport profile did not correspond to any of the currently known carnitine transporters such as organic cation carnitine transporter 1  Octn1   Octn2  Octn3  B0   and Ct2  In fact  in our experiments  the mRNA expressions for such carnitine transporters in 661W cells were consistently very low and the carnitine transporter substrates did not inhibit the uptake activities  Taken as a whole  our results indicate that carnitine is transported into 661W cells in a carrier mediated manner  However  since its transport modes cannot be fully explained by known carnitine transporters  it is highly likely that photoreceptor cells utilize a unique molecularly based carnitine uptake system",

performed on a separate set of 35 thymic malignancies  For cell based studies  a thymoma cell line was used  RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering revealed 100  concordance between gene expression clusters and WHO subtype  A substantial differentiator was a large microRNA cluster on chr19q13 42 that was significantly overexpressed in all A and AB tumours and whose expression was virtually absent in the

clinical responses against colon cancer The history of immunizing with embryonic materials to generate an antitumor immune response dates back to a century ago  The premise is that cancer cells share the expression of oncofetal antigens with embryonic materials and that the  immune response against these antigens in the embryonic tissues is cross protective against cancer  However  such a practice has never advanced beyond experimental animal settings  because of lack of uniformed source tissues  and ethical challenges  With the availability of well characterized human pluripotent stem cells  it is now possible to ask whether tumor protective immunity could indeed be elicited with stem cells  Herein  we investigated whether vaccination with defined human embryonic stem cells  hESCs  or induced pluripotent stem  iPS  cells was effective against a colon carcinoma  We discovered that vaccination of mice with hESC line H9 generated consistent cellular and humoral immune responses against CT26 colon carcinoma  Protection correlated strongly with the expansion of tumor responsive and interferon gamma producing cells and the profound loss of CD11b   Gr 1    myeloid derived suppressor cells in the spleen  No evidence of autoimmunity was observed  We also compared the immunogenicity against colon cancer between a hESC line CT2 and an iPS cell line TZ1 that were generated in the same stem cell facility  We found that the iPS cell line was inferior to the hESC line in conferring tumor protection  suggesting that there is heterogeneity of expression of oncofetal antigens by hESCs and iPS cells  We conclude that the hESC based vaccine is a promising modality for immunotherapy of cancer", "cell_id": "CVCL_B847"}, {"title": "Entry of cholera toxin into polarized human

patients with non metastatic cT2 4 N0 2 rectal cancer  within 7 cm of the anal verge  Downstream Akt activation was assessed in an independent set of pretreatment biopsies and in colorectal cancer cell lines using immunohistochemistry and western blot respectively  The radiosensitizing effects of the Akt inhibitor MK2206 were assessed using clonogenic assays and xenografts in immunodeficient

phosphorylation  P   0\u00b7001  and phosphatidylinositol signalling pathways  P   0\u00b7050  were identified as significantly enriched pathways among the set of differentially expressed genes  Deregulation of both pathways is known to result in Akt activation  and high immunoexpression of phosphorylated Akt S473 was observed among patients with a poor histological response  tumour

50 per cent improvement in sensitivity to CRT was observed in vitro and in vivo when SW480 cells were exposed to the Akt inhibitor MK2206 in combination with radiation and 5 fluorouracil  CONCLUSION: Akt activation is a key event in the response to CRT  Pharmacological inhibition of Akt activation may enhance the effects of CRT  Surgical relevance Organ preservation is an attractive alternative in rectal cancer management following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy  CRT  to avoid the morbidity of radical surgery  Molecular steps associated with tumour response to CRT may provide a useful tool for the identification of patients who are candidates for no immediate surgery  In this study  tumours resistant to CRT were more likely to have activation of specific genetic pathways that result in phosphorylated Akt  pAkt  activation  Pretreatment biopsy tissues with high immunoexpression of pAkt were more likely to exhibit a poor histological response to CRT  In addition  the introduction of a pAkt inhibitor to cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo led to a significant improvement in sensitivity to CRT  Identification of pAkt activated tumours may thus allow the identification of poor responders to CRT  In addition  the concomitant use of pAkt inhibitors to increase sensitivity to CRT in patients with rectal cancer may constitute an interesting strategy for increasing the chance of a complete response to treatment and organ preservation", "cell_id": "CVCL_B847"}, {"title": "A mutated cholera toxin without the ADP ribosyltransferase activity induces cytokine production and
