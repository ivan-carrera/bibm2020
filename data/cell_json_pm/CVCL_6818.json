DRE  in sensitive genes  The Ig heavy chain  IgH  gene is a sensitive target of TCDD and may be transcriptionally inhibited by TCDD through inhibition of the 3'IgH transcriptional regulatory region  3'IgHRR   While the 3'IgHRR contains binding sites for several transcription factors  two DRE motifs were also identified which may be responsible for TCDD induced inhibition of 3'IgHRR activation and

AhR ligands and non AhR ligands  from environmental  industrial  dietary or pharmaceutical origin are also capable of modulating the 3'IgHRR and to verify a correlation between effects on a stable 3'IgHRR reporter and the endogenous IgH protein  Utilizing a CH12 LX mouse B cell line that stably expresses a 3'IgHRR regulated transgene  we identified an inhibition of both 3'IgHRR activation and IgH protein expression by the non dioxin AhR activators indolo 3 2 b carbazole  primaquine  carbaryl  and omeprazole which followed a rank order potency for AhR activation supporting a role of the AhR in the transcriptional regulation of the 3'IgHRR and IgH expression  However  modulation of the 3'IgHRR and IgH expression was not limited to AhR activators or to suppressive effects  Hydrogen peroxide and terbutaline had an activating effect and benzyl isothiocyanate was inhibitory  These chemicals are not known to influence the AhR signaling pathway but have been previously shown to modulate humoral immunity and or transcription factors that regulate the 3'IgHRR  Taken together these results implicate the 3'IgHRR as a sensitive immunological target and are the first to identify

Most recently we have demonstrated that CH12 LX is a model of cytokine driven IgA differentiation  Recently  transforming growth factor beta  TGF beta  has been shown to be a probable switch factor for IgA in LPS stimulated mouse lymphocytes  therefore we chose CH12 LX B cells to study the effect of IL 4  TGF beta and LPS in IgA isotype switching  Adding TGF beta to the monoclonal cell line CH12 LX results in induction of mIgA expression but no enhancement of IgA secretion similar to the effect of IL 4  The addition of LPS serves as a non specific stimulus to enhance the secretion of the expressed immunoglobulin  but has no IgA specific activity of its own  IL 4 and TGF beta together are synergistic for mIgA expression  Pretreatment studies show that TGF beta added after IL 4 is the same as TGF beta alone whereas the converse is the same as adding both cytokines together  TGF beta acts by increasing the steady state levels of alpha message  whereas northern analysis indicates that IL 4 does not induce alpha message the way TGF beta does  These data confirm that TGF beta by itself is an isotype switch factor for IgA  In addition  IL 4 and TGF beta cause mIgA expression through different mechanisms  CH12 LX B cells serve as a valuable model to study the role of multiple signals required for mIgA expression and IgA secretion", "cell_id": "CVCL_6818"}, {"title":

site with repressor function for the  B cell lineage specific transcription factor BSAP  NF HB  S alpha BP Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays  EMSAs  we have identified several target sites for nuclear proteins in the murine heavy chain Ig 3' alpha enhancer  Two of these sites  denoted oligo H and oligo K  were shown by several criteria   including cell distribution and stimulation experiments  EMSA cross competition studies  and proteolytic clipping bandshift assays  to bind to the same protein identical to the transcription factor B cell lineage specific activator protein  BSAP   NF HB  S alpha BP   To assess the possible functional role of these BSAP  binding sites in the 3' alpha enhancer  we transiently transfected a construct containing a 314 bp 3' alpha enhancer fragment upstream of a luciferase reporter  gene in MOPC 315 cells  a plasmacytoma line lacking BSAP  In these cells  co transfection with a vector expressing recombinant BSAP led to significant reduction in the activity of the 3' alpha enhancer fragment  Conversely  in the mature B lymphoma cell line CH12 LX  a cell line that expresses BSAP and has a less active 3' alpha enhancer  selective BSAP down regulation by an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was sufficient to considerably up regulate 3' alpha enhancer activity  as were mutations of both binding sites that prevented binding of BSAP to the 3' alpha enhancer  Our findings thus suggest that the natural loss of BSAP expression in terminally differentiated plasma cells contributes to the activation of the murine Ig 3'
