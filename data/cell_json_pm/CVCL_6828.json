autocrine growing cells seems related to  the anti tumor function of interleukin 4 Recently  the failure of interleukin 4  IL4  autocrine growing CT4S cells to grow in vivo has been demonstrated  Because it could not be excluded that the cells produce insufficient amounts of IL4 to support their growth in vivo  subclones were established which are unresponsive to exogenous IL4 and therefore have acquired full growth autonomy  From the fact that the subclones likewise did not  give rise to tumors when injected into nude mice  one may conclude that the IL4 production of autocrine growing CT4S prevents their growth in vivo  To test this  hypothesis  a retroviral vector containing the IL4 gene under the control of the  immunoglobulin heavy chain  Igh  enhancer promoter was constructed and used to infect the myeloma cell line J558L  An IL4 producing clone was established  J558L XEPIL4  and the tumor progression in comparison to the parental clone J558L was monitored in nude mice  The IL4 production significantly delayed the growth of J558L XEPIL4 in vivo  Tumor suppression was much more evident when J558L XEPIL4 cells were injected into syngeneic BALB c mice  These results may explain why autocrine growing CT4S do not grow in vivo and suggest the involvement of functional T lymphocytes in the effectiveness of the host dependent anti tumor action of IL4", "cell_id":
