and used the Cu 1 10 phenanthroline 2SO4 mediated disulfide cross linking method to probe possible interactions of engineered Cys between the two identical subunits  The results show that several residues in one subunit closely interact with the same  residues in the other subunit; mutating these residues to Cys does not lead to large loss in enzyme activity  Helical wheel analysis suggests that these residues are located at one side of the coil  In contrast  mutating residues F453  A457  or H460 to Cys causes large loss in enzyme activity; the latter residues are located at the opposite side of the coil  A similar arrangement is found for residues in TMD8  Thus  helical coils in TMD7 and TMD8 have two distinct functional sides: one side is involved in substrate binding catalysis

amount of intracellular cholesterol ester when grown in medium containing 10  fetal calf serum  Chang  T  Y   and Limanek  J  S   1980  J  Biol  Chem  255  7787 7795   The higher cholesterol ester content of 25 RA is due to an increase in the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein receptor activity compared to wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells  and not due to an abnormal acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase enzyme  The procedure to isolate cholesterol ester deficient mutants utilizes amphotericin B  a polyene antibiotic known to bind to cholesterol and to form pore complexes in membranes  After incubation in  cholesterol free medium plus an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis  25 RA cells were found to be 50 500 times more sensitive to amphotericin B killing than were mutant cells containing reduced amounts of cholesterol ester  Twelve amphotericin B resistant mutants were isolated which retained the 25 hydroxycholesterol resistant phenotype  These mutants did not exhibit the perinuclear lipid droplets characteristic of 25 RA cells  and lipid analysis revealed a large  up to 40 fold  reduction in cellular cholesterol ester  The acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activities of these cholesterol ester deficient mutants were markedly lower than 25 RA when assayed in intact cells or in an in vitro reconstitution assay  The tightest mutant characterized   AC29  was found to have less than 1  of the parental acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity  These mutants all have reduced rates of sterol synthesis and lower low density lipoprotein receptor activity compared to 25 RA   probably as a consequence of their reduced enzyme activities  Cell fusion experiments revealed that the phenotypes of all the mutants

normal tissues  This experimental study aimed to examine the potential of modified vaccinia virus  VV  to treat MPM when administered alone or as an adjuvant treatment to surgery  METHODS: Two aggressive murine mesothelioma cell lines  AC29  AB12   were used  Cell viability and viral cytopathic effects were assessed using MTS and crystal violet assays  Immunocompetent mice were injected intraperitoneally with MPM cells and treated with intraperitoneal VV  Tumor bearing mice also underwent cytoreductive surgery  CRS  followed by VV  or control  therapy  RESULTS: The cytotoxic effects of VV on MPM cell lines was significantly increased compared with the control non cancer cell line  In both orthotopic models  VV induced tumor regression  prolonging median and long term survival  VV treatment after incomplete CRS was not superior to VV alone; however  when mice with microscopic disease were treated with VV  further prolongation of median and long term survivals was observed  CONCLUSIONS: VV selectively kills MPM cells in vitro and leads to improved survival and cures in immunocompetent murine models  Higher efficacy of the virus in the microscopic disease context suggests the use of the virus as an adjuvant treatment to complete surgical resection  These promising results justify further studies of VV in humans as a novel treatment for MPM", "cell_id": "CVCL_4407"},
