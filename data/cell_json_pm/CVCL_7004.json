and Africa  including sooty mangabey monkeys  Cercocebus atys   Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMC  from a mangabey naturally infected with both SIV and STLV I  T cell lines were established and maintained continuously for more than 3 years; these cell lines harbored only a newly identified mangabey STLV I sm  or both STLV I sm  and the acutely lethal variant SIVsmmPBj14  The dually infected cell line  FEd P14  was established by de novo infection of mangabey PBMC with SIVsmmPBj14  This cell line was characterized by multiple assays which showed that structural proteins encoded by both viruses were produced in large quantities  but that the predominant viral glycoprotein on the cell surface was the STLV I sm  Env  Unusual interactions of the two retroviral glycoproteins were suggested by the formation of syncytia between Raji and the FEd P14 cells  but not between Raji and simian cells infected with only one retrovirus or human cells infected with HTLV I  The STLV I sm  strain obtained from the sooty mangabey was transmitted to normal macaque and mangabey PBMC and was shown to be  unique by sequencing of the entire env gene  STLV I sm  from this African species was more closely related to \"cosmopolitan\" HTLV I strains than to the prototypic  STLV I from an Asian pig tailed macaque  In vitro and in vivo studies of STLV I sm  and SIVsmm  both

been demonstrated in many neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases  Geissoschizine methyl ether  GM  is an active alkaloid ingredient in the traditional Chinese medicine Uncaria hook  It has been shown that GM has strong potency in neuroprotective activity and GM reduces the production of reactive oxygen species by regulating glucose metabolism  which protects neurons against oxidative stress induced cell death  However  it is unknown whether GM could regulate neuronal lipid metabolism during oxidative challenge  AIM OF THE STUDY: The current study aimed to explore whether GM regulates lipid metabolism in oxidative damaged neurons and to determine the underlying mechanism involved in this neuro protection  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a glutamate induced oxidative toxicity model in mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line  HT 22\u00a0cells   we investigated the effect of GM on glutamate induced lipid peroxidation  lipotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction  In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the neuroprotection by  GM  lipid metabolomics was performed to investigate whether GM prevent oxidative  stress induced lipid metabolism disruption  Furthermore  the expression of lipid  metabolism related genes was measured  RESULTS: The results show the protective effect of GM against oxidative stress through blocking glutamate induced lipid peroxidation and lipotoxicity  Overall   lipidomics analysis revealed that glutamate treatment resulted in different extents of changes in a wide range of lipid classes such as fatty acids  FA

GM prevented the disruption of lipid metabolism by regulating the expression of lipid homeostasis  related genes  which contributes to preserve mitochondrial function under oxidative damage

melanoma cell lines  HBL  C8161 and A375SM  used; they increased the invasive ability of HBLs which were unable to invade on their own; they potentiated the invasion of C8161 cells which were invasive in their own right  but reduced the invasion of A375 SM cells which were aggressive invaders in the absence of skin cells  Latent forms of MMP 2  and MMP 9  were clearly expressed by the normal skin cells whereas all three melanoma lines weakly expressed these proteases  Fibroblast and keratinocyte MMPs were activated specifically by culture on type I collagen and on dermis which retained an intact basement membrane  These findings demonstrate that while there is an active communication between melanoma cells and adjacent skin cells  the invasive process is dictated by the melanoma cells and not the skin cells  However  activation of skin cell derived MMPs may play an important role in facilitating invasion by particular melanoma phenotypes", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"}, {"title":

revealed marked leukocytosis  shift to left with 13  blasts  There was evident dysgranulopoiesis  that raised a provisional diagnosis of myelodysplastic myeloproliferative neoplasm  Bone marrow  BM  examination revealed granulocytic hyperplasia with 10  blasts and significant dysgranulopoiesis  Unexpectedly  cytogenetic analysis revealed t 9;22  with BCR ABL1 rearrangement  diagnostic of chronic myeloid leukemia in an accelerated phase  The patient was started on dasatinib 100 mg upfront  however  he failed to respond  with increasing leukocytosis  Repeat BM examination showed persistence of the findings with 8  blasts  At this time  aggregates of mast cells with aberrant expression of CD25 were elicited  thus concluding the diagnosis of SM AHN  The patient failed multiple lines of treatment  dasatinib  nilotinib  hydroxyurea  cytarabine subcutaneous  6 mercaptopurine and interferon  and progressed to the blast phase a few months later  CONCLUSIONS We report an unusual case of CML  presented with significant dysgranulopoiesis with an aggressive clinical course including SM uncovered during the disease course with subsequent transformation to the blast phase  The  different biological behavior of this case underscores the need for studies on a  larger number of cases to explore the significance of the aforementioned coexistent features", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"},

"Synergistic growth inhibitory effects of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors  dasatinib and PKC412  on neoplastic mast cells expressing the D816V mutated oncogenic variant of KIT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In a majority of all patients with systemic mastocytosis  SM  including those with mast cell leukemia  MCL   neoplastic mast  cells  MC  display the D816V mutated variant of KIT  The respective oncoprotein   KIT D816V  exhibits constitutive tyrosine kinase  TK  activity and has been implicated in malignant cell growth  Therefore  several attempts have been made to identify KIT D816V targeting drugs  DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the effects of the novel TK inhibitor dasatinib alone and in combination with other targeted drugs on growth of neoplastic MC  RESULTS: Confirming previous studies  dasatinib was found to inhibit the TK activity of wild type  wt  KIT and KIT D816V as well as growth and survival of neoplastic MC and of the MCL cell line  HMC 1  The growth inhibitory effects of dasatinib in HMC 1 cells were found to be associated with a decrease in expression of CD2 and CD63  In addition  we found that dasatinib blocks KIT D816V induced cluster formation and viability in Ba F3 cells  In drug combination experiments  dasatinib was found to co operate with PKC412  AMN107  imatinib  and 2CdA in producing growth inhibition and apoptosis in neoplastic MC  In HMC 1 1 cells lacking KIT D816V  all drug interactions were found to be synergistic in nature  By contrast  in HMC 1 2 cells exhibiting KIT D816V  only the combinations dasatinib PKC412 and dasatinib 2CdA were found to produce synergistic effects  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of targeted drugs may represent an interesting pharmacologic approach for the treatment of aggressive SM or MCL", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"}, {"title": "beta Sitosterol inhibits HT 29 human colon cancer cell growth and alters membrane lipids", "index": "PMID:8917388", "document":

supplied to the media in the form of sterol cyclodextrin complexes  The cyclodextrin used was 2 hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin  The sterol to cyclodextrin molar ratio was maintained at 1:300  The study indicated that 8 and 16 microM beta sitosterol were effective at cel growth inhibition as compared to cholesterol or to the control  no sterol supplementation   After supplementation with 16

there an effect of these fatty acid changes on the unsaturation index  beta sitosterol incorporation resulted in an increase in the  U I  It is possible that the observed growth inhibition by beta

similar cytotoxic effects as SM  METHODS: Basal expression levels of 1920 miRNAs in total were analyzed in HaCaT SM compared to the origin human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT  The effect for selected miRNAs on cell survival was analyzed using antagomirs for ectopic miRNA level decrease or miRNA mimics for increase  Cell survival was calculated as SM dose dependent curves  RESULTS: Out of 1920 miRNAs analyzed  49 were significantly up  and 29 were significantly downregulated in HaCaT SM when compared to HaCaT controls  Out of these  36 could be grouped in miRNA families  Most of the 15

regimen for assessing the biocompatibility of potential biomaterials before experimentation in animal models  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urinary tract derived normal human urothelial  NHU  and smooth muscle  SM  cells were grown in monoculture as autologous cell lines  Permacol was assessed for its ability to support colonization by NHU and SM cells  The failure of the Permacol matrix to be infiltrated by SM cells was further investigated using the highly invasive EJ bladder cancer cell line  RESULTS: NHU cells readily attached and grew as a monolayer on the surface of Permacol  Cells stratified when the culture medium was supplemented with 2 mmol L calcium  EJ cells initially grew on the surface and subsequently invaded the matrix  while SM cells only colonized the surface of Permacol when cocultured with NHU cells  Cytoxicity  evaluated by contact inhibition and conditioned medium assays  excluded the presence of soluble toxins in the biomaterial  CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple  reproducible and rigorous regimen for assessing potential biomaterials in vitro  Applying this system might reduce the  use of animals and help to identify causes of potential bio incompatibility  The  inability of SM cells to penetrate the Permacol matrix suggests that required matrix bound signalling factors are absent  possibly as a result of the procedures used for processing Permacol  Identifying the key regulatory factors that regulate SM cell growth and orchestrate regenerative processes in the urinary tract will be important for developing suitable

 3  at the level of microfilaments: the decrease in polymerized actin and a large decrease of \u03b1 SM actin synthesis; and  4  at the level of extracellular matrix: very few fibronectin fibres

Alkylphospholipid  APL  analogues are promising candidates in the search for treatments for cancer  In contrast to standard chemotherapeutic drugs  these lipophilic agents target the cell membrane without interacting directly with DNA  A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to explain the actions of these compounds  which can induce apoptosis and or cell growth arrest  In this review   we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the actions of clinically relevant APLs  such as hexadecylphosphocholine  HePC   edelfosine  erucylphosphocholine  ErPC  and perifosine on the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line  which is commonly used for lipid metabolism studies with a special emphasis on cholesterol metabolism  One consistent finding is that HePC and other APLs cause  a reduction in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine  PC  by inhibiting the rate limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase  CT   Our research group has been at the forefront in demonstrating that exposure to APLs affects cholesterol homeostasis in mammalian cells  Treatment with HePC  for example  causes a marked enhancement in cholesterol synthesis  which has been related to an impairment in the arrival of cholesterol at the endoplasmic reticulum  ER   In a similar way to HePC  edelfosine  ErPC and perifosine increase the de novo synthesis and uptake of cholesterol and also inhibit the arrival of plasma membrane cholesterol at the ER  which induces a significant cholesterogenic response in these cells  involving an increase in gene expression and higher levels of several proteins related to the biosynthetic pathway and receptor mediated uptake of cholesterol  It is generally accepted nowadays that the maintenance of a tightly controlled free cholesterol PC ratio is crucial to optimum cell behaviour and that alterations to this ratio may lead to necrosis and or apoptosis  Our results have considerable bearing on this idea because an increase in cholesterol biosynthesis associated with a decrease in the synthesis  of choline containing phospholipids and cholesterol esterification leads to a modification in the free cholesterol PC ratio in cells exposed to APLs  It is well accepted that cholesterol is critical for the formation of lipid rafts and therefore drugs that alter cell cholesterol content should modify the properties  of these membrane domains and consequently the signal transduction pathways  which depends upon lipid raft integrity  Results on the whole show that APLs share a common active mechanism consisting of disrupting PC and sphingomyelin  SM  biosyntheses and cholesterol homeostasis  all of which leads to a disturbance in the native membrane structure  thus affecting signaling processes  vital to cell survival and

dosage as a relevant mechanism contributing to the determination of ovarian  function in Turner syndrome STUDY QUESTION: What is the burden of X chromosome mosaicism in the occurrence of spontaneous menarche  SM  in Turner syndrome  TS ? SUMMARY ANSWER: SM was significantly associated with X chromosome mosaicism in the TS patients; a mosaicism with around 10  euploid cell line may predict spontaneous pubertal development when determined by molecular cytogenetic techniques on uncultivated tissues  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Spontaneous puberty can be observed in a minority of patients with TS  more frequently  but not exclusively  in those with a high level of 46 XX 45 X mosaicism at standard karyotype  The genetic mechanisms contributing to ovarian function in TS patients are still not determined  However  submicroscopic X linked and autosomal copy number variations  CNVs  have recently emerged as an important genetic risk category for premature ovarian insufficiency and may be involved in modulating the TS ovarian phenotype  STUDY DESIGN  SIZE  DURATION: A group of 40 patients with a diagnosis of TS at conventional karyotyping participated in the study; 6 patients had SM and 34 patients had primary amenorrhoea  PA   All clinical data and the patients' DNA samples were collected over the years at a single paediatric clinic  PARTICIPANTS MATERIALS  SETTING  METHODS: The patients' samples were used to perform both genetic  Copy Number Assay  and molecular cytogenetic  array CGH and iFISH  interphase FISH  analyses in order to evaluate the X chromosome mosaicism  rate and to detect possible rare CNVs of genes with a known or predicted role in  female fertility  MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: All TS patients showed variable percentages  of the 46 XX lineage  but these percentages were higher in the SM group  P   0 01   A mosaicism around 10  for the euploid cell line may predict spontaneous pubertal development when determined by molecular cytogenetic techniques performed in uncultivated tissues  A few CNVs involving autosomal and X linked ovary related loci were identified by array CGH analysis and confirmed by real time quantitative PCR  including a BMP15 gene duplication at Xp11 22  a deletion interrupting the PAPPA gene at 9q33 1  and an intragenic duplication involving the PDE8A gene at 15q25 3  LIMITATIONS  REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a pilot study on a relatively small sample size and confirmation in larger TS cohorts may be required  The ovarian tissue could not be studied in any patients and in a subgroup of patients  the mosaicism was estimated in tissues of different embryonic origin  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The combined determination of X chromosome mosaicism by molecular and molecular cytogenetic techniques may become useful for the prediction of SM in TS  The detection of CNVs in both X linked and autosomal  ovary related genes further suggests gene dosage as a relevant mechanism contributing to the ovarian phenotype of TS patients  These CNVs may pinpoint novel candidates relevant to female fertility and generate further insights into  the mechanisms contributing to ovarian function  STUDY FUNDING

"Relocalization of KIT D816V to cell surface after dasatinib treatment: potential  clinical implications BACKGROUND: Systemic mastocytosis  SM  is a heterogeneous disease that displays variable aggressivity  Adults with SM frequently have a D816V mutation in the tyrosine kinase  TK  receptor gene KIT  We previously reported that  in a Chinese hamster ovarian cell model expressing exogenous KIT variants  constitutive activating KIT mutations induced intracellular mislocalization of KIT reversed by inhibition of KIT TK activity  Hence  we hypothesized that inhibition of KIT kinase activity by the TK inhibitor dasatinib could be useful to increase KIT detection sensitivity in samples from patients with SM  PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested this hypothesis on a BaF 3 cell line modified to  express either KIT wild type  WT  or KIT D816V  on the human mastocytoma cell line HMC1 2  and among 28 patients with proven SM who did  n   24  or did not  n    4  carry the D816V KIT mutation and displayed various SM subtypes by using a simple flow cytometry assay to quantify KIT relocalization upon dasatinib treatment  RESULTS: We confirm KIT cell surface increase upon dasatinib treatment on BaF 3 KIT D816V and HMC1 2 cell lines but not on BaF 3 KIT WT cell line  The analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of patients with SM showed KIT surface level increase for patients with the KIT D816V mutation but not for patients who had no KIT mutation  Interestingly  the extent of KIT level relocalization correlates with SM severity  with a higher relocalization for patients with aggressive forms compared with indolent forms  CONCLUSIONS: Overall  results of this study suggests that treating the peripheral blood sample with dasatinib of a patient with SM before

significant IFA titers of   or equal to 1:160 as positive and  1:40 as negative  When compared to IFA  agreement  sensitivity and specificity for each ANA EIA screen were as follows: Elias: 87 0   69

patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  SLE   Among these IFN inducible genes  IFN induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 4  IFIT4  is a novel gene whose function is unknown  METHODS: In this study we examined the role played by IFIT4 in monocyte differentiation and the correlation between IFIT4 expression and the clinical manifestation of SLE  To this end  we used plasmid transfection  flow cytometry   mixed leucocyte responses  ELISA  quantitative RT PCR and Western blotting  RESULTS: We found that both IFIT4 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in PBMCs and monocytes from SLE patients than in those from  healthy control individuals  IFIT4 expression was positively correlated with antinuclear antibodies  anti double stranded DNA  and anti Sm auto immune antibodies in SLE  Patients with SLE exhibiting higher expression of IFIT4 had a  higher prevalence of leucopenia  thrombocytopenia and C3 C4 decrease  IFIT4 protein was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm  and it was significantly upregulated by IFN alpha in normal PBMCs  To determine the role played by IFIT4 in monocyte differentiation  the monocytic cell line THP 1 was transfected with pEGFP IFIT4 expression plasmid and stimulated with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor IL 4 to generate IFIT4 primed dendritic cell like cells  DCLCs   IFIT4 primed DCLCs acquired morphological characteristics of dendritic cells more quickly  with greater resemblance to dendritic cells  as compared with DCLCs primed with pEGFP C1 control plasmid trasfection  Furthermore  they exhibited higher expressions of CD40  CD86  CD80  HLA DR and CD83  along with lower expression of CD14; increased IL 12 secretion; and an increased ability to  stimulate T cell proliferation  In addition  IFIT4 primed DCLCs enhanced IFN gamma secretion  about 2 4 fold  by T cells compared with controls  CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that IFIT4 might play roles in promoting monocyte differentiation into DCLCs and in directing DCLCs to modulate T helper 1 cell differentiation; these actions might contribute to the autoimmunity and pathogenesis of SLE",

liver  Fl1sa on chromosome 12  was identified in a SM J\u2009\u00d7\u2009SMXA 5 intercross  The SMXA 5 genome consists of the SM J and A J genomes  and the A J allele of Fl1sa is a fatty liver susceptibility allele  The existence of the responsible genes for fatty liver within Fl1sa was confirmed in A J 12 SM  consomic mice  The aim of this study was to identify candidate genes for Fl1sa  and to investigate whether the identified genes affect the lipid metabolism  RESULTS: A J 12 SM  mice showed a significantly lower liver triglyceride content  compared to A J mice when fed the high fat diet for 7\u00a0weeks  We detected differences in the accumulation of liver lipids in response to the high fat diet  between A J and A J 12 SM  consomic mice  To identify candidate genes for Fl1sa   we performed DNA microarray analysis using the livers of A J 12 SM  and A J mice  fed the high fat diet  The mRNA levels of three genes  Iah1  Rrm2  Prkd1  in the  chromosomal region of Fl1sa were significantly different between the strains  Iah1 mRNA levels in the liver  kidney  and lung were significantly higher in A J 12 SM  mice than in A J mice  The hepatic Iah1 mRNA level in A J 12 SM  mice  was 3 2 fold higher than that in A J mice  To examine the effect of Iah1 on hepatic lipid metabolism  we constructed a stable cell line expressing the mouse  Iah1 protein in mouse hepatoma Hepa1 6 cells  Overexpression of Iah1 in Hepa1 6 cells suppressed the mRNA levels of Cd36 and Dgat2  which play important roles in triglyceride synthesis and lipid metabolism  CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that Fl1sa on the proximal region of chromosome 12 affected fatty liver in mice on a high fat diet  Iah1  isoamyl acetate hydrolyzing esterase 1 homolog  was identified as one of the candidate genes for Fl1sa  This study revealed that the mouse Iah1 gene regulated the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in the liver", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"}, {"title": "Somatomedin C

we performed a comprehensive analysis of the marker profile  growth properties  transfectability  and SMC promoter activity in four rat SMC lines  A7r5  adult and pup aortic  and PAC1   Despite alterations in chromosomal number and structure  A7r5  adult aortic  and PAC1 cells express all SMC markers studied including SM alpha actin  SM calponin  SM22  tropoelastin  and to a lesser extent  SM myosin heavy chain  SMMHC   In contrast  pup aortic cells express very low or undetectable levels of all the above markers except tropoelastin  Adult aortic  pup  and PAC1 cells display similar growth curves and levels of proto oncogene transcripts  whereas those in the A7r5 line are comparatively less  All cell lines studied except pup cells show expression of SMC differentiation genes during active growth  indicating that growth and differentiation are not mutually exclusive in cultured smooth muscle  Transfection studies reveal dramatic differences in DNA uptake and SMC restricted promoter activity between cell lines  Collectively  these results provide detailed information relating to SMC molecular biology in culture that should facilitate the selection of a cell line for studying the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying SMC differentiation", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"}, {"title": "Extra  and intracellular imaging of human matrix metalloprotease 11  hMMP 11

tissue cell line models BACKGROUND: Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm  Myrtaceae  is a plant used in traditional medicine to control obesity  insulin resistance and diabetes  Chronic adipose tissue inflammation is involved in generating insulin resistance  the greatest risk factor in developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease  In the present study  a mixture of triterpenes  as obtained from the starting plant  material  was evaluated in inflamed adipose tissue cells models  AIM: Our goal is to advance into the understanding  at the cellular level  of the immunometabolic effects of the triterpene mixes from Eucalyptus tereticornis in in vitro models of mouse and human adipose tissues  METHODS: Triterpene mixes were obtained from Eucalyptus tereticornis leaves by organic extraction  The major compounds of these mixes were identified by 1H NMR  and 13C NMR in addition to HPLC using primary and secondary standards of ursolic  acid  oleanolic acid and ursolic acid lactone  To provide an approach for evaluating the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which triterpene mixes act to modify the metabolic processes associated with obesity  mouse macrophage and adipocyte cell lines  human macrophage cell line and primary culture of human adipocytes were used as models  RESULTS: Adipocytes treated with the two natural chemically characterized triterpene mixes partially reduce lipogenesis and leptin expression  Additionally  an increase in the transcriptional expression of PPAR\u03b3  and C EBP\u03b1  is observed  In macrophages  these triterpene mixes  decrease the transcriptional and translational expression of pro inflammatory cytokines  such as interleukin 6  IL 6   interleukin 1\u03b2  IL 1\u03b2  and tumoral necrosis factor \u03b1  TNF\u03b1   Conditioned  medium of 3T3 L1 adipocytes treated with the triterpene mix shows a stronger anti inflammatory response on activated J774A 1 macrophages  CONCLUSION: The mixtures of the three triterpenes in the proportions obtained from the plant material may act on different components of the cell  generating a different response  which  in some cases  is more powerful than that seen when exposure to only two triterpenes  It makes this three triterpenes mix a good phytotherapeutic prototype for pathologies as complex as those associated with obesity", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"}, {"title":

was no  remarkable change when they were cultured with CM from untreated cells  The level of smoothelin mRNA and SM MHC protein increased after treatment with CM from BPH 1  The CM from BPH 1 with oestradiol stimulation was more effective in stimulating smoothelin mRNA and SM MHC protein level  The protein level of collagen type IV  but not fibronectin  was up regulated in the supernatants and cell extracts of CM treated stromal cells  Oestradiol enhanced the expression and secretion of TGF beta 1 in BPH 1 cells  TGF beta 1 neutralizing antibody abrogated the effect of BPH 1 CM on the

of insulin like growth factor I dependent deoxribonucleic acid synthesis in FRTL 5 cells: mediation by an autocrine amplification factor s Studies were undertaken to determine the mechanism s  by which TSH and insulin like growth factors  IGFs  act synergistically to stimulate DNA synthesis in FRTL 5 cells  As observed in previous studies  the response of these cells to  a combination of TSH plus IGFs  or micromolar concentrations of insulin  greatly  surpass the sum of the effects of the individual hormones when acting alone  Part of this synergism was eliminated when media containing TSH and IGF I were replaced every 4 h with fresh media  This suggested that part of the synergism between TSH and IGF I on cell proliferation is mediated by an amplification factor s   AF  released from FRTL 5 cells during incubation  The AF was not specific for thyroid cells  however  since conditioned medium from TSH treated FRTL 5 cells was also found to potentiate the mitogenic effect of IGF I in the human fibroblast cell line GM3652  It is unlikely that the AF activity secreted by these cells in response to TSH is either IGF or an IGF binding protein  since  the anti IGF monoclonal antibody sm 1 2 did not attenuate the synergism between TSH and high concentrations of insulin on thymidine incorporation  Analysis of thymidine incorporation into DNA at different times after different patterns of exposure to TSH  IGF I  or TSH plus IGF I suggested that at least part of the synergism between the two hormones resulted from increasing the number of quiescent cells recruited into the cell cycle  These results suggested that the TSH dependent AF might be acting as a competence factor  In a preliminary screen  of candidate growth factors  only fibroblast growth factor  FGF  simulated the effect of AF  and its effect was smaller than that obtained with TSH treated FRTL 5 cells  After preincubation with TSH  FRTL 5 cells exhibited greatly increased responsivity to the mitogenic effects of IGF I that was manifested by both increased sensitivity to IGF I  as judged by a decreased EC50  and an increase in their maximum response  TSH pretreatment  likewise  amplified subsequent DNA synthesis in response to serum and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate   Thus  the mitogenic effect of TSH in FRTL 5 cells is due not only its stimulation of IGF production  but also to its stimulation of one or more AF that greatly enhance the responsivity of these cells to mitogenic stimuli", "cell_id": "CVCL_7004"}, {"title": "Anti angiogenic activity of para coumaric acid methyl

"A personal view on the early history of the insulin like growth factors", "index": "PMID:10592460", "document": "A personal view on the early history of the insulin like growth factors Salmon and Daughaday  when trying to set up an in vitro assay for Growth Hormone   GH   failed to obtain a direct effect on sulphate uptake in cartilage of hypophysectomized  hypox  rats  They recognised that this was not the consequence of poor methodology or materials  but an encrypted message from the examined system  They decided to turn around and to try and decipher it  Treatment with GH appeared to render hypox rat serum active in stimulating sulphation in hypox rat  cartilage  They proposed that GH induced an intermediary substance  responsible for this biological effect: sulphation factor  SF   later renamed to Somatomedin s   SM   This hypothesis met with great criticism and very few took on to study this hypothetical substance  Besides disbelief  slow progress was also due to initial lack of a practical assay and to the failure to find a tissue with enriched concentration from which to extract the activity  From experimental evidence  the concept gradually evolved that SF SM was insulin like and might be  identical to NSILA  non suppressible insulin like activity   This again generated controversy  This characteristic was too far away from the known effects of GH to be readily acceptable as a physiological phenomenon  The subsequent recognition of the distinct characteristics of the receptors for SM NSILA and insulin  the discovery of the SM NSILA binding proteins and  much later  a beginning understanding of their interactions  modifications and breakdown  have gradually  resolved this apparent contradiction  When the sequence of two NSILA molecules became known  they were named IGF I and  II  Structural similarity with proinsulin and identity of IGF I with SM C and  A were established and it was found that Multiplication Stimulating Activity  MSA   a growth factor isolated from fetal calf serum and subsequently from conditioned media of a rat liver cell line  was the rat equivalent of IGF II  Structure function relations could be studied  a quest which is not yet brought to an end  Meanwhile  the endocrine profile of SF SM had gradually emerged by measuring plasma levels with bioassays  The main determinants were found to be age  body size  GH and the nutritional state  Later  radioimmunoassays were developed  enabling consolidation and detailing of these early observations  and allowing explorations at the tissue level  As another aspect of the endocrine paradigm  in vivo effects of IGFs were  studied  The initial demonstration of an effect of crude preparations on longitudinal growth in experimental animals raised heavy scepticism  since the effect might have been an artefact caused by contaminants  It took confirmation with highly purified preparations and biosynthetic IGF I to ease this concern  Still  not until recent years it was demonstrated  by knocking out the genes  that a true physiological and not a pharmacological effect had been induced previously  When it was found that most tissues produce SMs and are sensitive to  their actions  the concept emerged that IGFs may have para  and autocrine functions  Early experiments with combinations of growth factors in cell cultures had begun to define their specific roles in the cell cycle as competence or progression factors  SM C fell in the latter category  Still  the awareness grew  that  for obtaining physiologically meaningful results on the role of IGFs in complex  dynamic and tissue specific environments  involving interactions of many hormones and growth factors  the intactness of tissue was a prerequisite  One result of this approach was the discovery of a direct interaction of GH with cartilage  leading  in concert with IGFs  to a clonal expansion of the cartilage  cells of the growth plate  The isolation and sequencing of the IGF I and  II genes  and later  of six IFG BPs initiated the gradual elucidation of structure and function at the DNA and RNA level and the study of natural and synthetic IGF variants  The generation of
