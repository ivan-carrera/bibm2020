"Identification and characterization of subpopulations of the free alpha subunit that vary in their ability to combine with chorionic gonadotropin beta The free  uncombined  alpha subunit of hCG is secreted in excess over alpha beta  dimer from both malignant and nonmalignant trophoblast cells and is secreted ectopically from a variety of other malignant cell types  The free alpha subunits from various sources are distinguishable from those that combine because they migrate more heterogeneously and more slowly on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  SDS PAGE  than dimer alpha  We have previously identified three posttranslational modifications that may contribute to the altered mobility of the free alpha subunit and to its inability to combine with the beta subunit: 1  preferential phosphorylation of the free alpha subunit  2  O glycosylation of free alpha  and 3  differences in the processing of the asparagine linked oligosaccharides between the free and combinable forms  We have purified three populations of the alpha subunit from the JAR choriocarcinoma cell line and from ChaGo  a bronchogenic carcinoma cell line that ectopically synthesizes only the alpha subunit  in order to identify the posttranslational modifications that contribute to the altered mobility on SDS PAGE  Fractionation  of the oligosaccharides released from the alpha forms with peptide N glycosidase  has shown that the faster migrating alpha forms on SDS PAGE have less completely  processed oligosaccharide chains  Twenty two to 25  of the JAR free alpha and 35 41  of the ChaGo alpha forms that migrate the fastest on SDS PAGE recombine with beta in an in vitro recombination assay under conditions where 62  of the dimer alpha form recombines  In contrast  only 5 12  and 16 21  of the JAR free alpha and ChaGo alpha forms  respectively  that migrate the slowest on SDS PAGE recombine with beta  The form of JAR free alpha least capable of combining with beta contains on O linked glycan on Thr 39  This same site is a substrate for phosphorylation by JAR cells  However  most of ChaGo alpha fails to recombine with beta even though ChaGo alpha contains little O linked carbohydrate  These results suggest that the larger asparagine linked complex glycans on the slower migrating alpha forms are the major limiting factor for subunit combination  Although these modifications may not be rate limiting for combination in the rough endoplasmic reticulum  they may prevent dimerization of the free subunits later in the secretory pathway", "cell_id": "CVCL_DG43"},

  3 4 dihydroxybenzoic acid  5   taraxerol  6   taraxerone  7   and lupeol acetate  8  were isolated from Manilkara zapota bark   Their chemical structures were elucidated by analysis of their nuclear magnetic resonance  NMR  spectroscopy and mass spectrometry  MS  data  and by comparing them with data found in the literature  The in vitro antityrosinase  antioxidant  and cytotoxic activities of the isolated compounds  1 8  were evaluated      Dihydrokaempferol  4  exhibited higher monophenolase inhibitory activity than both kojic acid and \u03b1 arbutin  However  it showed diphenolase inhibitory activity similar to kojic acid      Dihydrokaempferol  4  was a competitive inhibitor of both monophenolase and diphenolase activities  It exhibited the strongest 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl  DPPH   2 2' azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid  ABTS   and ferric reducing antioxidant power  FRAP  activities of the isolated compounds  Furthermore      dihydrokaempferol  4  also demonstrated potent cytotoxicity in breast carcinoma cell line  BT474   lung bronchus carcinoma cell line  Chago K1   liver  carcinoma cell line  HepG2   gastric carcinoma cell line  KATO III   and colon carcinoma cell line  SW620   These results suggest that M  zapota bark might be a good potential source of antioxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors for applications  in cosmeceutical products", "cell_id": "CVCL_DG43"}, {"title": "Lymphoblastogenesis inhibitory factor produced by human lung cancer cell lines", "index": "PMID:141545", "document": "Lymphoblastogenesis inhibitory factor produced by human lung cancer cell lines A comparative study of the inhibitory effect of cell free supernatants  CFS  from human lung cancer cell lines  ChaGo and PC 1  and from a human embryo fibroblast  cell line on lymphocyte blastogenesis indicated that both lung cancer cell lines  produce a large amount of the inhibitory factor while the production of such a factor from a control noncancer cell line is essentially very minimal or absent   The inhibitory effect of CFS of the lung cancer cell lines is not due to direct cytotoxicity  The inhibitory effect is found to be partially sensitive to heat treatment  A significant inhibition is still seen  even when the CFS of the lung  cancer cell lines were present for 1 hour prior to the addition of phytohemagglutinin
