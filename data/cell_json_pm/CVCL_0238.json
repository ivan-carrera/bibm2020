enzymatic activity for drug metabolism  the CYP2C18 cDNA was cloned and a stable CHL cell line expressing recombinant CYP2C18 was established  METHODS: The human CYP2C18 cDNA was amplified with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  from total RNAs extracted from human liver and cloned into pGEM T vector  The cDNA segment was identified by DNA sequencing and subcloned into

expression of inflammation related proteins in Chang conjunctival cells PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of interferon  IFN gamma on cell viability  cell growth  and apoptosis and on expression of apoptotic and inflammation related proteins in epithelial conjunctival cells in vitro  Some aspects of transduction pathways of IFNgamma induced alterations were also investigated  especially the role of protein kinase C  PKC  and IFNgamma transcriptional factor STAT1  METHODS: A human conjunctival cell line was treated with different concentrations  30 and 300 U ml  of human recombinant IFNgamma  After 24  48  and 72 hours of treatment  cell viability and relative cell number were studied with 3  4 5 dimethylthiazol 2yl 2 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide  MTT  and crystal violet colorimetric assays  The apoptotic process was sought by phase contrast microscopy  4' 6' diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride  DAPI  staining  and transmission electron

RESULTS: IFNgamma at 30 U ml induced no change in cell cycle and in cell viability  Cell viability significantly decreased after 48 hours of treatment with 300 U ml IFNgamma  associated with cell

IFNgamma treated cells overexpressed plasma membrane Fas  HLA DR  and ICAM 1 in a dose  and time dependent manner  and STAT1 in both nuclear and cytosolic cell fractions  Only 300 U ml IFNgamma

the  effect of hypoxia on TH gene expression  Northern blot analyses of total RNA were performed on PC12 cells exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors  The addition of the L type calcium channel blockers nifedipine or verapamil caused partial inhibition of the hypoxia induced increase in TH mRNA  The increase in cytosolic Ca2  during hypoxia was also only partially

observed in the expression of the major histocompatibility  MHC  class I and II antigens  Because protein kinase C  PKC   is known to regulate cell proliferation  apoptosis and expression of MHC

These two aspects were addressed at the 5th International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing  IWGT  held in Basel  Switzerland  on August 17 19  2009  The objectives of the working group  WG  were to make recommendations on the use of cell types or lines  if possible  and to provide evaluations of promising new approaches  Results obtained in rodent cell  lines with impaired p53 function  L5178Y  V79  CHL and CHO cells  and human p53 competent cells  peripheral blood lymphocytes  TK6 and HepG2 cells  suggest that a reduction in the percentage of non relevant positive results for carcinogenicity prediction can be achieved by careful selection of cells used without decreasing the sensitivity of the assays  Therefore  the WG suggested using p53  competent   preferably human   cells in in vitro micronucleus or chromosomal aberration tests  The use of the hepatoma cell line HepaRG for genotoxicity testing was considered promising since these cells possess better phase I and II metabolizing potential compared to cell lines commonly used in this area and may overcome the need for the addition of S9  For dermally applied  compounds  the WG agreed that in vitro reconstructed skin models  once validated  will be useful to follow up on positive results from standard in vitro assays as  they resemble the properties of human skin  barrier function  metabolism   While  the reconstructed skin micronucleus assay has been shown to be further advanced   there was also consensus that the Comet assay should be further evaluated due to  its independence from cell proliferation

our results indicate that the exposure of cells to NaAsO2 resulted in cytotoxicity and cell death  at least in part  due to the inhibition of eIF4E gene expression leading to diminished cellular

encoding dihydrofolate reductase  alleles present in the Chinese hamster lung  CHL  cell line  DC 3F  The relative abundancy of the transcripts produced from each allele  differs dramatically as a result of differential utilization of the multiple poly A  sites present in the DHFR DHFR gene and a genetic polymorphism located within the third poly A  signal of one allele  We sought to determine whether such differences in polyadenylation affect the steady state levels of DHFR and mRNAs expressed from either allele and  in a more general sense  to ask whether differences in 3' end RNA processing in a gene containing multiple poly A  sites  affects the final level of gene expression  An SV40 promoter based transient expression system producing chimeric cat::DHFR transcripts was developed to regenerate the in vivo mRNA polyadenylation patterns associated with each of the  two DHFR alleles  The results demonstrate that the total amount of polyadenylated RNA expressed from each of these constructs in vitro is the same regardless of the differential utilization of the poly A  signals that occurs between them  Moreover  measurement of the individual turnover rates of the DHFR mRNAs expressed in vivo from each allele  as determined by pulse chase labeling and actinomycin D inhibition studies  revealed no significant allele specific differences in transcript half lives  Finally  measuring the steady state levels  of DHFR poly A   mRNA in parental DC 3F cells demonstrated that both alleles are  expressed to the same extent during normal growth  Thus  even though dramatic allele specific differences in 3' end processing of DHFR transcripts occur in vivo  such differences do not appear to influence the steady state levels of DHFR gene expression", "cell_id":

of whether the three commercially available antiglaucoma prostaglandin analogs could protect the same cell line in vitro against BAC toxicity and whether an antioxidative mechanism could be involved

MCF 7 cells upon cytoplasmic microinjection of these proteins implicated a loss in Apoptin's signature targeting activity  CONCLUSIONS: Therefore  the critical stretch spanning amino acid 1 31 at the upstream of a known hydrophobic leucine rich stretch  LRS  was strongly suggested as one of the prerequisite region in Apoptin for cancer targeting  Identification of this selective domain provides a platform for developing small targets to facilitating carrier mediated transport across cellular membrane  simultaneously  promoting protein delivery for selective and effective breast cancer

GSH  and mitochondrial  function of a CCA cell line  KKU M214  METHODS: Cytotoxic effects of PEITC on a CCA cell line  KKU M214  and a reference cell line  Chang cells were evaluated  To delineate mechanisms of cell death  the following parameters were measured; GSH and superoxide levels as the oxidative status parameters  apoptosis related proteins levels using Western blotting  Cellular free calcium level and mitochondrial transmembrane potential were also measured  RESULTS: PEITC induced apoptotic cell death of both KKU M214 and Chang cells  After PEITC treatment  both cells showed decrease of Bcl xl and increase of Bax levels  While KKU M214 cells released AIF  Chang cells released cytochrome c  with subsequent activation of caspase 3 and 9  upon PEITC treatment  PEITC induced superoxide formation in both cells  although it seemed not play a role in cell death  PEITC caused GSH redox stress in different ways in two cell types  because N acetylcysteine  NAC  prevented redox stress in Chang but not in KKU M214 cells  The loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was induced by  PEITC concurrent with GSH stress  but was not a primary cause of cell death  The  rapid increase of free calcium level in cytosol was associated with cell death in both cell lines  These events were prevented by NAC in Chang cells  but not in KKU M214 cells  CONCLUSION: PEITC induced cell death KKU M214 cells and Chang cells via increase  of cellular calcium mobilization and activation of mitochondrial cell death pathway  The effects of PEITC on the redox stress was mediated via different ways in CCA and Chang cells because NAC could prevent redox stress in Chang cells  but not in KKU M214 cells  The multiple effects of PEITC may be useful for the development of novel

content of 25 RA is due to an increase in the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis and low density lipoprotein receptor activity compared to wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells  and not due to an abnormal acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase enzyme  The procedure to isolate cholesterol ester deficient mutants utilizes amphotericin B  a polyene antibiotic known to bind to cholesterol and to form pore complexes in membranes  After incubation in  cholesterol free medium plus an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis  25 RA cells were found to be 50 500 times more sensitive to amphotericin B killing than were mutant cells containing reduced amounts of cholesterol ester  Twelve amphotericin B resistant mutants were isolated which retained the 25 hydroxycholesterol resistant phenotype  These mutants did not exhibit the perinuclear lipid droplets characteristic of 25 RA cells  and lipid analysis revealed a large  up to 40 fold  reduction in cellular cholesterol ester  The acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activities of these cholesterol ester deficient mutants were markedly lower than 25 RA when assayed in intact cells or in an in vitro reconstitution assay  The tightest mutant characterized   AC29  was found to have less than 1  of the parental acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity  These mutants all have reduced rates of sterol synthesis and lower

immunofluorescence assay  Western blot analysis and plaque titration  The apoptotic response of the infected cells was quantitated by ELISA  detecting the enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm  Western blot analysis was used to determine the levels of Bcl 2 and Bax proteins  RESULTS: The WK cell line was highly permissive to VSV replication and was highly susceptible for the CPE of this

could be identified in HUH 7 and WRL 68 cells  A polyclonal antiserum raised against SR BI significantly decreased cell association of  3H CE HDL3 in HUH 7 and WRL 68  The present findings suggest that the capacity for selective cholesteryl ester uptake from high density lipoprotein by malignant and normal epithelial cells from the liver  depends on expression of the scavenger receptor class B

standard method for the treatment of breast cancer  the photodynamic therapy  PDT  is a recent promising modality for cancer  diagnosis and treatment  Its major advantages over chemotherapy are better selectivity of tumour tissue destruction and lack of severe local and systemic complications  This work is directed towards evaluation of the efficacy of Photodynamic therapy using chlorophyll derivative  CHL  as a photosensitizer in treatment of breast cancer  It also aims at investigation of the genetic safety of chlorophyll mediated PDT in comparison to the conventional chemotherapy  METHODS: Both methotrexate  MTX  and light activated chlorophyll derivative were  used to target MCF 7 breast cancer cell line  Standard karyotyping and alkaline single cell microgel electrophoresis

 The effect of a variation in structure of caf1 was  found to lead to a change in the respective antiproliferative properties: caf1 induces loss of viability in HCT116  MDA MB 231  and HepG2; the complex shows only moderate effects in non tumor Chang liver cells  caf1 exerts lower cytotoxic activity than Bu2SnCl2  suggesting that the binding with H3CAF modulates the marked cytotoxic activity exerted by Bu2SnCl2; caf1 displays a considerably more  pronounced antitumoural effect towards cell lines than caffeic acid  It is known  that caffeic acid can modulate DNA  cytosine 5

analysis and viable cell counting were used to assay for chromosomal aberrations and cytotoxicity induced in a Chinese hamster lung cell line  CHL IU  exposed to different MWCNTs  RESULTS: Using scanning electron microscopy  seven MWCNTs were classified into three types: straight fibrous  curved fibrous  and tangled  The straight fibrous  MWCNTs were the strongest inducers of polyploidy and the most cytotoxic among the three types of MWCNTs  The curved fibrous MWCNTs induced more polyploidy than the tangled MWCNTs  and the cytotoxicity of both types seemed to be a reflection of their

6 cells  beta catenin seemed to exert an important protective role against apoptosis  since pretreatment with beta catenin antisense ODN reduced the content of beta catenin and anticipated the onset of apoptosis at 8 h of exposure to butyrate  Moreover  in HuH 6 cells  butyrate induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential  release of cytochrome c from mitochondria  activation of caspase 9 and

At specific times  cultures were halted and cells received a pro oxidant stimulus  cumene  CuOOH  0 5 mmol l   at which time  cell viability  by trypan blue staining and lactate dehydrogenase  LDH  release   and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  TBARS  concentration  spectrophotometrical assay  were evaluated  RESULTS: At concentrations ranging from 0 1 micromol l to 1 micromol l  DHEA protects Chang liver cells against lipid peroxidation and or death induced by cumene  This effect disappears if the concentration is increased to 10 micromol l; at higher concentrations  50 micromol l  a pro oxidant cytotoxic effect of DHEA appears  CONCLUSIONS: DHEA exhibits two opposed effects on lipid peroxidation; depending on its concentration it acts either to limit or to induce oxidative stress  The threshold concentration at which the pro oxidant activity of DHEA prevails is not far in excess of that having an antioxidant effect  Either effect of DHEA on lipid peroxidation is only evident after a 'lag phase'", "cell_id": "CVCL_0238"}, {"title": "Detection of interferon inhibitors or antagonists in gastrointestinal malignancies", "index": "PMID:9951903", "document": "Detection of interferon inhibitors or antagonists in gastrointestinal malignancies BACKGROUND AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the IFN inhibiting activity in sera from patients with

gastric cancer and 18 with colon cancer were tested  while sera from 37 healthy blood donors were used as controls  All serum samples  collected before any kind of treatment  were tested for IFN blocking and endogenous IFN like activity  These activities were determined by assaying the inhibition of the vesicular stomatitis virus specific cytopathic  effect in three cell lines: A549 cells

using a  transmission electron microscope  RESULTS: The result demonstrated that Hep88 mAb can bind to the recombinant mortalin  HSPA9  and alpha enolase  In addition  the gradual appearing of

of programmed cell death  Apoptosis was  confirmed by a cleavage of PARP and CPP32  by caspase 8 activation  and by an index Hoechst neutral red greater than one  All these modifications were preceded

Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg  HRS  cells which are thought to be derived  from germinal center B cells  In cHL  the HRS cells constitute less than 1  of the tumor volume; consequently the profile of genetic aberrations in cHL is still poorly understood  DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study  we subjected four commonly used cHL cell lines to array comparative genomic hybridization  aCGH  in order to delineate known chromosomal aberrations in more detail and to search for small hitherto undetected genomic imbalances  RESULTS: The aCGH profiles of the four cell lines tested confirmed the complex patterns of rearrangements previously demonstrated with M FISH and chromosomal CGH  cCGH   Importantly  aCGH allowed a much more accurate delineation of imbalances as compared to previous studies performed at chromosomal level of resolution  Furthermore  we detected 35 hitherto undetected aberrations including a homozygous deletion of chromosomal region 15q26 2 in the cell line HDLM2 encompasing RGMA and CHD2 and an amplification of the STAT6 gene in cell line L1236 leading to STAT6 overexpression  Finally  in cell line KM H2 we found a 2 35 Mb deletion at 16q12 1 putatively defining a small critical region for the recurrent 16q deletion in cHL  This region contains the CYLD gene  a known suppressor gene of the NF mB pathway  INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: aCGH was performed on four cHL cell lines leading to the improved delineation of known chromosomal imbalances and the detection of  35 hitherto undetected aberrations  More specifically  our results highlight

induced cell death without resistance toward this anti neoplastic agent  However  the dose response effects  were varying largely between different cell lines  The effect of NAC and BSO co treatment were highly different among cell lines  suggesting a cell line specific involvement of ROS in TRD induced cell death  Furthermore  impact of z VAD mediated inhibition of caspases was differing

a strong correlation was found between NS     and CAs     at each dosage  Therefore  we hypothesized that  clastogens cause NS in cultured mammalian cells  since the mouse lymphoma L5178Y  cell line

support adherence of gonococci through interactions of OpaA with cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans  However  despite this similarity in the requirements for adherence  CHO cells are not

Using a combination of chromatographic purification procedures  we identified the adhesive glycoprotein  vitronectin as the serum factor which mediates the internalization of gonococci by CHO cells  Vitronectin depleted serum did not support gonococcal entry  and this deficiency was restored by the addition of purified vitronectin  Further experiments using a set of gonococcal recombinants  each expressing a single member of the family of Opa outer membrane proteins  demonstrated that vitronectin bound to the surface of OpaA producing gonococci only and that the vitronectin mediated uptake by the CHO cells was limited to this bacterial phenotype  To our knowledge  our data are the first example that vitronectin can  serve as a molecule that drives bacterial entry into epithelial cells",

criteria were applied  a database including 96 publications and 34 compounds was  obtained  For 30 of these compounds  data on both tests were available  For 24 of the 30  concordant results in both test systems were obtained  80  correlation    The discordant results in 6 compounds can be explained by a known or suspected aneugenic potential of these compounds  Considering that cell types and test protocols were extremely heterogeneous  this correlation is rather encouraging  Comparison of the different protocols  and experience established within the working group yielded several recommendations for the routine use of the in vitro micronucleus test  Although many cell lines are suitable  those most often used in genotoxicity testing  e g  CHL  CHO  V79  human lymphocytes  L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells  are recommended  Cytochalasin B may be used in the case of human  lymphocytes; however  the possibility of its interaction with aneugenic test compounds should be considered  For continuously dividing cell lines  cytochalasin B is not recommended by the working group  Although  there seems to  be flexibility in the choice of treatment and sampling times  the average generation time of the chosen cell line of choice should be taken into account when determining sampling time  and treatment of cells for at least one cell cycle duration is recommended  The use of appropriate cytotoxicity tests is strongly recommended  Although studies on some parameters of the test protocol may be useful  the introduction of the in vitro micronucleus test into genotoxicity testing and guidelines should not be delayed  Even in its present state  the in vitro micronucleus is a reliable genotoxicity test  Compared with the chromosomal aberration test  it detects aneugens more reliably  it is faster  and easier to perform  and it has more statistical power and the possibility of automation", "cell_id": "CVCL_0238"}, {"title": "Morphology based

significant cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines M HeLa and MCF 7  Three  lead compounds exhibited selective cytotoxic activities against M HeLa  IC50   10 0 15 1 \u03bcM  that were three times better than the cytotoxicity of the anti cancer drug Tamoxifen  IC50   28 0 \u03bcM   Moreover  the lead compounds were not cytotoxic with respect to the normal human cell line Chang liver  IC50   100  \u03bcM   whereas Tamoxifen inhibited the viability of normal human Chang liver cells  with an IC50 value of 46 0 \u03bcM  It was determined that the cytotoxicity of the lead compounds was due to induction of apoptosis proceeding along the mitochondrial pathway  The cytotoxic activity of the synthesized compounds substantially depended on the nature of the monosaccharide residue and its position  that is  whether the monosaccharide residue was attached directly to the isosteviol skeleton or was moved away from it by means of a polymethylene linker", "cell_id": "CVCL_0238"}]}
