samples from 152 stage I III  BCa patients were examined for FGFR2 and RSK2 gene and protein expression  FGFR2  showed a positive correlation with RSK2 at both protein  p\u00a0 \u00a00 003  and messenger RNA  mRNA   p\u00a0 \u00a00 001  levels  Lack of both FGFR2 and activated RSK  RSK P  significantly correlated with better disease free survival  DFS   p\u00a0 \u00a00 01   Patients with tumours displaying immunoreactivity for either or both FGFR2 and RSK P had 4 89 fold higher risk of recurrence when compared to the FGFR2 RSK P negative subgroup  FGFR2 RSK2 interactions were verified by co immunoprecipitation and internalization assays in HB2 mammary epithelial cell  line  characterized by high endogenous FGFR2 and RSK2 expression   In vitro analyses revealed that FGFR2 and RSK2 formed an indirect complex and that activated RSK exerted a significant impact on fibroblast growth factor 2  FGF2  triggered internalization of FGFR2  Our results suggest that the FGFR2 RSK2 signalling pathway is involved in pathophysiology of BCa and evaluation of FGFR2 RSK P expression may be useful in disease prognostication", "cell_id": "CVCL_2261"}]}
