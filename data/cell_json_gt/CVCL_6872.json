A list of cross contaminated or misidentified cell lines Continuous cell lines consist of cultured cells derived from a specific donor and tissue of origin that have acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely  These cell lines are well recognized models for the study of health and disease   particularly for cancer  However  there are cautions to be aware of when using continuous cell lines  including the possibility of contamination  in which a foreign cell line or microorganism is introduced without the handler's knowledge  Cross contamination  in which the contaminant is another cell line  was first recognized in the 1950s but  disturbingly  remains a serious issue today  Many cell lines become cross contaminated early  so that subsequent experimental work  has been performed only on the contaminant  masquerading under a different name   What can be done in response how can a researcher know if their own cell lines are cross contaminated? Two practical responses are suggested here  First  it is  important to check the literature  looking for previous work on cross contamination  Some reports may be difficult to find and to make these more accessible  we have compiled a list of known cross contaminated cell lines  The list currently contains 360 cell lines  drawn from 68 references  Most contaminants arise within the same species  with HeLa still the most frequently encountered  29   106 360  among human cell lines  but interspecies contaminants  account for a small but substantial minority of cases  9   33 360   Second  even  if there are no previous publications on cross contamination for that cell line   it is essential to check the sample itself by performing authentication testing", "cell_id": "CVCL_6872"}, {"title": "Assembly and initial characterization of a panel of 85 genomically validated cell lines from diverse head and neck tumor sites", "index": "PMID:21868764", "document": "Assembly and initial characterization of a panel of 85 genomically validated cell lines from diverse head and neck tumor sites PURPOSE: Human cell lines are useful for studying cancer biology and preclinically modeling cancer therapy  but can be misidentified and cross contamination is unfortunately common  The purpose of this study was to develop a panel of validated head and neck cell lines representing the spectrum of tissue sites and histologies that could be used for studying the molecular  genetic  and phenotypic diversity of head and neck cancer  METHODS: A panel of 122 clinically and phenotypically diverse head and neck cell  lines from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  thyroid cancer  cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  adenoid cystic carcinoma  oral leukoplakia  immortalized primary keratinocytes  and normal epithelium was assembled from the collections of several individuals and institutions  Authenticity was verified by carrying out short tandem repeat analysis  Human papillomavirus  HPV  status and cell morphology were also determined  RESULTS: Eighty five of the 122 cell lines had unique genetic profiles  HPV 16 DNA was detected in 2 cell lines  These 85 cell lines included cell lines from the major head and neck primary tumor sites  and close examination shows a wide range of in vitro phenotypes  CONCLUSIONS: This panel of 85 genomically validated head and neck cell lines represents a valuable resource for the head and neck cancer research community that can help advance understanding of the disease by providing a standard reference for cell lines that can be used for biological as well as preclinical studies", "cell_id": "CVCL_6872"}, {"title": "Genetic profiling reveals an alarming rate of cross contamination among human cell lines used in China", "index": "PMID:26116706", "document": "Genetic profiling reveals an alarming rate of cross contamination among human cell lines used in China Cell lines are widely used as in vitro model systems in biologic and medical research  However  much of the research has been invalidated by the unwitting use of false cell lines  A significant proportion of the research involving human cell lines was initiated in China  Paradoxically  the cell lines used in China have never been authenticated  Here  we present a comprehensive survey of cross contamination in 380 samples from 113 independent sources in China using short tandem repeat profiling methods  High levels of cross contamination were uncovered  95 of 380  25    Notable false cell lines  e g   KB and WISH  are still actively used under their false identity and tissue attributions  Most strikingly  85 51  of lines established in China were misidentified  59 of 69  and accounted for over half of the misidentifications  59 of 95  62 11    Further  93 22  of the contaminants in cell lines established in laboratories of  China were HeLa cells or a possible hybrid of HeLa with an unknown cell line  Results from these misidentified lines have been published in thousands of potentially erroneous articles and may have distorted the findings visible to the scientific community  False lines have been used in drug screening  potentially leading to unusable or even harmful therapeutic strategies  We also noted the causes of contamination and provided suggestions for remediation", "cell_id": "CVCL_6872"}]}
