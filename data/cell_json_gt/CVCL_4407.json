mesothelioma Malignant mesothelioma  MM  is an aggressive tumour of the serosal cavities which is associated with previous asbestos exposure and is generally found to be resistant to conventional forms of therapy  Adequate scientific and clinical assessment of this disease has been severely limited by the relatively low incidence of mesothelioma and the lack of representative cell lines and animal models  The purpose of this study was to develop an asbestos induced murine model of MM both as an in vivo passaged malignancy and as in vitro established cell lines  Such a model system would be invaluable for use in the study of various cellular  molecular and genetic aspects of the disease  and for the pre clinical  evaluation of potential therapeutic agents  BALB c and CBA mice were injected intraperitoneally with crocidolite asbestos  Seven to 25 months after exposure  35  of the mice developed mesothelioma  5 BALB c  9 CBA   as determined by standard cytological and histological parameters  From these primary tumours  12  continuously growing cell lines  5 BALB c  7 CBA  were established in culture  All have been confirmed as mesothelioma by cytological and

chemokine gene expression in mouse mesothelioma and mesothelial cells:  TNF \u03b1 upregulates both CC and CXC chemokine genes Many cancers express an array of chemokines which have the capacity to modulate the nature and function of intratumoural leukocyte infiltrates  In malignant mesothelioma  MM  neither the chemokine signalling networks nor their regulation  have been investigated despite the prominence of leucocytic infiltrates in both clinical and experimental tumours  In this study  we examined constitutive and cytokine regulated expression of CC and CXC chemokine genes in mesothelioma and mesothelial cell cultures derived from two different mouse strains  BALB C and CBA CaH   In mouse MM and mesothelial cells MCP 1 JE  GRO \u03b1 KC and RANTES were expressed whereas MIP 1\u03b1 and MIP 2 were infrequently expressed  Comparison of basal chemokine expression showed that GRO \u03b1 KC mRNA was overexpressed in the malignant cells whereas MCP 1 gene expression and release was downregulated  Treatment of mesothelioma cells with IL 4  IFN \u03b3 or TNF \u03b1 revealed that chemokine genes could be more responsive to cytokines in the malignant compared to their mesothelial cells  TNF \u03b1 was consistently the most potent positive regulator of both CC and CXC chemokine expression and MCP 1 release  The present study for the first time provides a mechanistic insight into the differential regulation of chemokine expression in malignant mesothelioma cells and has implications for mesothelial chemokine signalling in mouse models", "cell_id": "CVCL_4407"},

type murine model of malignant mesothelioma BACKGROUND: Malignant mesothelioma  MM  is an aggressive cancer of the pleural and peritoneal cavities caused by exposure to asbestos  Asbestos induced mesotheliomas in wild type mice have been used extensively as a preclinical model because they are phenotypically identical to their human counterpart  However  it is not known if the genetic lesions in these mice tumours are similar to in the human disease  a prerequisite for any new preclinical studies that target genetic abnormalities  METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing of fifteen asbestos induced murine MM tumour cell lines from BALB c  CBA and C57BL 6 mouse strains and compared the  somatic mutations and copy number variations with those recurrently reported in human MM  We then catalogued and characterised the mutational landscape of the wild type murine MM tumours  Quantitative RT PCR was used to interrogate the expression of key MM genes of interest in the mRNA  RESULTS: Consistent with human MM tumours  we identified homozygous loss of the tumour suppressor Cdkn2a in 14 15 tumours  One tumour retained the first exon of  both of the p16INK4a and p19ARF isoforms though this tumour also contained genetic amplification of Myc resulting in increased expression of the c Myc proto oncogene in the mRNA  There were no chromosomal losses in either the Bap1 or Nf2 regions  One tumour harbored homozygous loss of Trp53 in the DNA  Mutation rates were similar in tumours generated in the CBA and C57BL 6 strains when compared to human MM  Interestingly  all BALB c tumour lines displayed high mutational loads  consistent with the known mutator phenotype of the host strain  The Wnt  MAPK and Jak STAT signaling pathways were found to be the most commonly  affected biological pathways  Mutations and copy number deletions also occurred in the Hedgehog and Hippo pathways  CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in the wild type murine model asbestos causes mesotheliomas in a similar way to in human MM  This further supports the notion that the murine model of MM represents a genuine homologue of the human disease  something uncommon in cancer  and is thus a valuable tool to provide insight into MM tumour development and to aide the search for novel therapeutic strategies", "cell_id": "CVCL_4407"}]}
