A list of cross contaminated or misidentified cell lines Continuous cell lines consist of cultured cells derived from a specific donor and tissue of origin that have acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely  These cell lines are well recognized models for the study of health and disease   particularly for cancer  However  there are cautions to be aware of when using continuous cell lines  including the possibility of contamination  in which a foreign cell line or microorganism is introduced without the handler's knowledge  Cross contamination  in which the contaminant is another cell line  was first recognized in the 1950s but  disturbingly  remains a serious issue today  Many cell lines become cross contaminated early  so that subsequent experimental work  has been performed only on the contaminant  masquerading under a different name   What can be done in response how can a researcher know if their own cell lines are cross contaminated? Two practical responses are suggested here  First  it is  important to check the literature  looking for previous work on cross contamination  Some reports may be difficult to find and to make these more accessible  we have compiled a list of known cross contaminated cell lines  The list currently contains 360 cell lines  drawn from 68 references  Most contaminants arise within the same species  with HeLa still the most frequently encountered  29   106 360  among human cell lines  but interspecies contaminants  account for a small but substantial minority of cases  9   33 360   Second  even  if there are no previous publications on cross contamination for that cell line   it is essential to check the sample itself by performing authentication testing", "cell_id": "CVCL_2260"}]}
