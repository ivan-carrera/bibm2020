by flow cytometry  RESULTS: We report a strong correlation between both specific KRAS mutational subtype and CNV  and sensitivity to MEK inhibition  Cell lines with a KRAS  V12   mutation and KRAS gains or loss  n 7  are \u223c10 times more resistant than those having neither a KRAS  V12  mutation nor KRAS CNV  n 14   Significant differences in baseline and MEK162 induced gene expression exist between the sensitive and resistant lines  especially in genes involved in RAS  EGF receptor and PI3K pathways  This was further supported by difference in signal transduction  MEK 162 blocked ERK1 2  as well as inhibited PI3K and S6 and increased p27KIP1 levels in the sensitive lines  CONCLUSIONS: Given the potency of MEK162  it may be a promising new therapy for patients with pancreatic cancer and KRAS mutational subtypes  and CNV may serve as important biomarkers for selecting patients that benefit from MEK targeting based on these preclinical data", "cell_id": "CVCL_0186"}, {"title": "A

proliferative capacity  whereas the other two subtypes  glycolytic and lipogenic  showed distinct metabolite levels associated with glycolysis  lipogenesis  and redox pathways  confirmed at the transcriptional level  The glycolytic and lipogenic subtypes showed striking differences in glucose and glutamine utilization  as well as mitochondrial function  and corresponded to differences in cell sensitivity to inhibitors of glycolysis  glutamine metabolism  lipid synthesis  and redox balance  In PDAC clinical samples  the lipogenic subtype associated with the epithelial  classical  subtype  whereas the glycolytic subtype strongly associated with the mesenchymal  QM PDA  subtype  suggesting functional relevance in disease progression  Pharmacogenomic screening of an additional

tumor budding was observed and BxPC 3 cells were found to be more resistant to gemcitabine than those in the fibroblast poor co culture  Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin was increased at the invasive front of fibroblast rich co cultures  In addition  in mouse xenografts of fibroblast rich co cultures  tumors were larger and had a higher Ki 67 index

the acquisition of cancer drug resistance in pancreatic and other cancers  To evaluate the potential contribution of miRNAs in acquired resistance  to cisplatin in pancreatic cancer  we compared levels of more than 2000 human miRNAs in a cisplatin resistant cell line  BxPC3 R  derived from parental  BxPC3  cells by step wise exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug over more than 20 passages  The acquired drug resistance was accompanied by significant changes in the expression of 57 miRNAs  of which 23 were downregulated and 34 were upregulated  Employing a hidden Markov model  HMM  algorithm  we identified  downregulation of miR 374b as likely being directly involved in acquisition of the drug resistant phenotype  Consistent with this prediction  ectopic overexpression of miR 374b in the resistant BxPC3 R cells restored cisplatin sensitivity to levels approaching those displayed by the BxPC3 parental cells  The results are consistent with a growing body of evidence

resistance  in two distinct parental PDAC cell lines  AsPC1 and BxPC3  and to subsequently examine the molecular mechanisms associated with the acquired resistance  Cisplatin resistance in both resistant cell lines was found to be multifactorial  and to be associated with mechanisms related to drug transport  drug inactivation  DNA damage response  DNA repair and the modulation of apoptosis  Our results demonstrate that the two resistant cell lines employed alternative molecular strategies in acquiring resistance dictated  in part  by pre existing molecular differences between the
