"Dopaminergic differentiation of the Nurr1 expressing immortalized mesencephalic cell line CSM14 1 in vitro The use of neural stem cells as grafts is a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease  but the potential of stem cells to differentiate into dopaminergic neurones requires investigation  The present study examined the in vitro differentiation of the temperature sensitive immortalized mesencephalic progenitor cell line CSM14 1 under defined conditions  Cells were derived from the mesencephalic region of a 14 day old rat embryo  retrovirally immortalized with the Large T antigen and cultured at 33 degrees C in DMEM containing 10  fetal calf serum  FCS   For differentiation  the temperature was elevated at 39 degrees C and FCS was reduced  1    Using histology  immunocytochemical detection of the stem cell marker Nestin and the neuronal marker MAP5 and  in addition  Western blotting to determine the presence of neurone specific enolase and the neurone nuclei antigen we demonstrated a differentiation of these cells into neuronal cells accompanied by a decrease in Nestin production  In Western blots   we detected the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 in these cells  This was followed by a time dependent up regulation of the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 characteristic of mature dopaminergic neurones  Our in vitro model of dopaminergic cell differentiation corroborates recent in vivo observations in the developing rodent brain", "cell_id": "CVCL_8182"}, {"title": "Transplantation of immortalized mesencephalic progenitors  CSM14 1 cells

caudate putamen The present study analyzed whether grafts of the mesencephalic progenitor cell line CSM14 1 into the neonatal rat caudate putamen  CPu  differentiate into neurons and whether this is accompanied by a functional improvement in 6 hydroxydopamine  6 OHDA  lesioned animals  As in previous studies  a neuronal differentiation of CSM14 1 cells transplanted into the CPu of adult animals could not be observed  so we here used neonatal rats  because graft location and host age seemingly are crucial parameters for neural transplant differentiation and integration  Rats bilaterally lesioned at postnatal day 1 by intraventricular 6 OHDA injections 2 days later received 100 000 CSM14 1 cells prelabelled with the fluorescent dye PKH26 into the right CPu  Five weeks after grafting  the cylinder test was performed  and the data compared with data from age matched intact controls and bilaterally lesioned only animals  Brain slices immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase  TH  were quantified by optical densitometry  We observed a significant preference of left forelimb use exclusively in transplanted animals  In these rats  TH containing perikarya were found in the grafted CPu  presumedly leading to the significant increase of TH immunoreactive  fibers in this region  Moreover  confocal laser microscopy revealed a differentiation of transplanted PKH26 labelled CSM14 1 cells into neuronal nuclei antigen or TH immunoreactive cells  Thus  CSM14 1 cells differentiate into TH containing neurons  which most probably contribute to the preferred forelimb use  indicating a functional integration of CSM14 1 cells into the host basal ganglia loops during early postnatal development  These findings that are in contrast to observations in adult rats suggest instructive cues for neuronal differentiation and integration given by the neonatal microenvironment", "cell_id": "CVCL_8182"}, {"title": "The proteome of the differentiating mesencephalic progenitor cell line CSM14 1

dopaminergic  DA  neurons from human embryonic mesencephalic tissue is a promising approach  However  the origin of these cells causes major problems: availability and standardization of the graft  Therefore  the generation of unlimited numbers of DA neurons from various types of stem or progenitor cells has been brought into focus  A source for DA neurons might be conditionally immortalized progenitor cells  The temperature sensitive immortalized cell line CSM14 1 derived from the  mesencephalon of an embryonic rat has been used successfully for transplantation  experiments  This cell line was analyzed by unbiased stereology of cell type specific marker proteins and 2D gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry to characterize the differentially expressed proteome  Undifferentiated CSM14 1 cells only expressed the stem cell marker nestin  whereas differentiated cells expressed GFAP or NeuN and tyrosine hydroxylase  An increase of the latter cells  during differentiation could be shown  By using proteomics an explanation on the  protein level was found for the observed changes in cell morphology during differentiation  when CSM14 1 cells possessed the morphology of multipolar neurons  The results obtained in this study confirm the suitability of CSM14 1 cells as an in vitro model for the study of neuronal and dopaminergic differentiation in rats",
