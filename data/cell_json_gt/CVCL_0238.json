A list of cross contaminated or misidentified cell lines Continuous cell lines consist of cultured cells derived from a specific donor and tissue of origin that have acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely  These cell lines are well recognized models for the study of health and disease   particularly for cancer  However  there are cautions to be aware of when using continuous cell lines  including the possibility of contamination  in which a foreign cell line or microorganism is introduced without the handler's knowledge  Cross contamination  in which the contaminant is another cell line  was first recognized in the 1950s but  disturbingly  remains a serious issue today  Many cell lines become cross contaminated early  so that subsequent experimental work  has been performed only on the contaminant  masquerading under a different name   What can be done in response how can a researcher know if their own cell lines are cross contaminated? Two practical responses are suggested here  First  it is  important to check the literature  looking for previous work on cross contamination  Some reports may be difficult to find and to make these more accessible  we have compiled a list of known cross contaminated cell lines  The list currently contains 360 cell lines  drawn from 68 references  Most contaminants arise within the same species  with HeLa still the most frequently encountered  29   106 360  among human cell lines  but interspecies contaminants  account for a small but substantial minority of cases  9   33 360   Second  even  if there are no previous publications on cross contamination for that cell line   it is essential to check the sample itself by performing authentication testing", "cell_id": "CVCL_0238"}, {"title": "The haplotype resolved genome and epigenome of the aneuploid HeLa cancer cell line", "index": "PMID:23925245", "document": "The haplotype resolved genome and epigenome of the aneuploid HeLa cancer cell line The HeLa cell line was established in 1951 from cervical cancer cells taken from  a patient  Henrietta Lacks  This was the first successful attempt to immortalize  human derived cells in vitro  The robust growth and unrestricted distribution of  HeLa cells resulted in its broad adoption  both intentionally and through widespread cross contamination  and for the past 60\u2009years it has served a role analogous to that of a model organism  The cumulative impact of the HeLa cell line on research is demonstrated by its occurrence in more than 74 000 PubMed abstracts  approximately 0 3    The genomic architecture of HeLa remains largely  unexplored beyond its karyotype  partly because like many cancers  its extensive  aneuploidy renders such analyses challenging  We carried out haplotype resolved whole genome sequencing of the HeLa CCL 2 strain  examined point  and indel mutation variations  mapped copy number variations and loss of heterozygosity regions  and phased variants across full chromosome arms  We also  investigated variation and copy number profiles for HeLa S3 and eight additional  strains  We find that HeLa is relatively stable in terms of point variation  with few new mutations accumulating after early passaging  Haplotype resolution facilitated reconstruction of an amplified  highly rearranged region of chromosome 8q24 21 at which integration of the human papilloma virus type 18  HPV 18  genome occurred and that is likely to be the event that initiated tumorigenesis  We combined these maps with RNA seq and ENCODE Project data sets to phase the HeLa epigenome  This revealed strong  haplotype specific activation  of the proto oncogene MYC by the integrated HPV 18 genome approximately 500\u2009kilobases upstream  and enabled global analyses of the relationship between gene dosage and expression  These data provide an extensively phased  high quality reference genome for past and future experiments relying on HeLa  and demonstrate the value of haplotype resolution for characterizing cancer genomes and epigenomes", "cell_id": "CVCL_0238"}]}
