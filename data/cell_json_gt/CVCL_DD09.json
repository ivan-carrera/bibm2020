glycoprotein processing inhibitor resistant  PIR  Chinese hamster ovary  CHO  cells was previously shown to result in a block at the Man5GlcNAc2 stage of the dolichol oligosaccharide biosynthetic pathway  Lehrman  M A   and Zeng  Y   1989  J  Biol  Chem  264  1584 1593   These cells had normal mannose P dolichol synthase activity and were able to transfer the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides to protein  We have now characterized the mutation in greater detail  In PIR cells  biosynthesis of GDP mannose and mannose P dolichol was normal  and pulse chase analysis indicated that the rate of Man5GlcNAc2 P P dolichol formation in vivo was similar to that in parental CHO cells but without subsequent formation of larger intermediates  Cell fusion studies demonstrated that the PIR genotype was recessive and that PIR cells could complement the mutation in B4 2 1 cells  which fail to synthesize mannose P dolichol  In contrast to the results obtained with intact cells  incubation of membrane preparations of PIR cells with GDP  3H mannose resulted in the synthesis of intermediates containing up to 9 mannose residues  indicating that the cells contained active mannosyltransferases VI to IX  With a simplified  assay for the formation of intermediates containing 6 to 9 mannoses  it was shown that physical disruption of PIR cells was able to eliminate the block at the pentamannosyl stage  Furthermore  although the temperature requirements of the reactions for the control CHO and PIR membranes were similar  Man5GlcNAc2 elongating activity in CHO membranes was inhibited by alkaline pH treatment  whereas this treatment irreversibly stimulated the activity in PIR membranes  Taken together  these results suggest that the PIR cells have a recessive defect  and that the missing gene product is required by mannosyltransferase VI in vivo for proper utilization of either mannose P dolichol or Man5GlcNAc2 P P dolichol  Since the defect was manifested in vivo but not in vitro  this requirement appears necessary for intact cells but not for disrupted cells or isolated membranes", "cell_id": "CVCL_DD09"}, {"title": "Complementing mutant alleles define three loci involved in mannosylation of Man5 GlcNAc2 P P dolichol in Chinese hamster ovary cells", "index": "PMID:2267628", "document": "Complementing mutant alleles define three loci involved in mannosylation of Man5 GlcNAc2 P P dolichol in Chinese hamster ovary cells Dolichol linked oligosaccharides consisting of two N acetylglucosamine  nine mannose  and three glucose residues  Glc3Man9GlcNAc2  are transferred to proteins that contain the consensus sequence Asn X Ser Thr  This transfer occurs upon protein import into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum  An intermediate in the biosynthesis of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 lipid linked oligosaccharide contains two GlcNAc and five mannose residues  This intermediate serves as a substrate for further mannosylation and glucosylation before transfer to protein  The addition  of the sixth mannose residue to this intermediate requires the enzyme mannosyltransferase VI and the mannose donor  mannose P dolichol  Several different CHO cell line mutants that fail to efficiently catalyze this transfer have been described  In this report  we examine seven independent mutant cell lines with various biochemical phenotypes and demonstrate that all can be assigned to one of three genetic complementation groups  One mutation affects mannose P dolichol biosynthesis  Lec15   three affect dolichol phosphate biosynthesis  Lec9   and three appear to affect the functional orientation of enzyme substrates  PIR", "cell_id": "CVCL_DD09"}, {"title": "Pleiotropic resistance to glycoprotein processing inhibitors in Chinese hamster ovary cells  The role of a

role of a novel mutation in the asparagine linked glycosylation  pathway In order to obtain a better understanding of the control mechanisms involved in asparagine linked glycosylation  we developed conditions under which the glucosidase I and II inhibitor castanospermine and the mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine were toxic to Chinese hamster ovary  CHO  cells when cultured in the  presence of low concentrations of the plant lectin concanavalin A  Cells resistant to castanospermine  CsR cells  and swainsonine  SwR cells  were obtained by gradual stepwise selections  These cells had normal levels of glucosidase II and mannosidase II and appeared to have no major structural alterations in their surface asparagine linked oligosaccharides  Interestingly  the CsR and SwR cells were each pleiotropically resistant to castanospermine  swainsonine  and deoxymannojirimycin  an inhibitor of mannosidase I  This resistance was not due to the multiple drug resistance phenomenon  Both the CsR and SwR cell populations synthesized Man5GlcNAc2 in place of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 as the major dolichol linked oligosaccharide  This defect was not due to a loss of mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthetase  Furthermore  the Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was transferred to protein and appeared to give rise to normal mature oligosaccharides  Thus  the CsR and SwR cells achieved resistance to castanospermine  swainsonine  and deoxymannojirimycin by synthesizing altered dolichol linked oligosaccharides that reduced or eliminated the requirements for  glucosidases I and II and mannosidases I and II during the production of normal asparagine linked oligosaccharides  We propose that this phenotype be termed PIR  for processing inhibitor resistance", "cell_id": "CVCL_DD09"}]}
