for ChaGo C5  HCG less than 0 3  alpha 21  and beta less than 0 5; and for JEG 3  HCG 18  alpha less than 0 7  and beta less than 0 5  The ChaGo K1 secretion rate of alpha was greater than that of any of out previously reported ChaGo clones  Significant quantities of estradiol  and progesterone accumulated in the media of all three cell lines; however  only  JEG 3 secreted detectable quantities of placental lactogen  Thus under identical  culture conditions  a bronchogenic carcinoma clonal line secreted only alpha subunit  whereas a choriocarcinoma line secreted only HCG; these findings implied major differences in cellular control mechanisms  Moreover  the ectopic secretions of alpha exceeded the eutopic trophoblastic secretion of HCG  which suggested that in certain cases ectopic protein production may be even more efficient than nonectopic production", "cell_id": "CVCL_1121"}, {"title": "Signatures of mutation and selection in the cancer genome", "index": "PMID:20164919", "document": "Signatures of mutation and selection in the cancer genome The cancer genome is moulded by the dual processes of somatic mutation and selection  Homozygous deletions in cancer genomes occur over recessive cancer genes  where they can confer selective growth advantage  and over fragile sites   where they are thought to reflect an increased local rate of DNA breakage  However  most homozygous deletions in cancer genomes are unexplained  Here we identified 2 428 somatic homozygous deletions in 746 cancer cell lines  These overlie 11  of protein coding genes that  therefore  are not mandatory for survival of human cells  We derived structural signatures that distinguish between homozygous deletions over recessive cancer genes and fragile sites  Application to clusters of unexplained homozygous deletions suggests that many are in regions of inherent fragility  whereas a small subset overlies recessive cancer genes  The results illustrate how structural signatures can be used to distinguish between the influences of mutation and selection in cancer genomes  The extensive copy number  genotyping  sequence and expression data available for this large series of publicly available cancer cell lines renders them informative reagents for future studies of cancer biology and drug discovery", "cell_id": "CVCL_1121"}, {"title": "A genome wide screen for microdeletions reveals disruption of polarity complex genes in diverse human cancers", "index": "PMID:20215515", "document": "A genome wide screen for microdeletions reveals disruption of polarity complex genes in diverse human cancers In a genome wide screen of 684 cancer cell lines  we identified homozygous intragenic microdeletions involving genes encoding components of the apical basal cell polarity complexes  Among these  PARD3 is disrupted in cell lines and primary tumors from squamous carcinomas and glioblastomas  Reconstituting PARD3 expression in both cell types restores tight junctions and retards contact dependent proliferation  Searching specifically for small intragenic microdeletions using high resolution genomic arrays may be complementary to other genomic deletion screens and resequencing efforts in identifying new tumor suppressor genes", "cell_id": "CVCL_1121"}, {"title": "The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity", "index": "PMID:22460905", "document": "The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging  Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available  Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia  CCLE : a compilation of gene expression  chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines  When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines  this collection allowed identification of genetic  lineage  and gene expression based predictors of drug sensitivity  In addition to known predictors  we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors;
